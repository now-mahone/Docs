# Kerne Protocol

**Primary Objective:** Make the owners as much money as possible, as quickly as possible, and as easily as possible.

Kerne is a delta-neutral synthetic dollar protocol on the Base network, leveraging LST collateral and CEX-based hedging to achieve its primary objective of maximizing owner wealth.

## Core Premise
The protocol is engineered for maximum capital efficiency and institutional-grade security. All architectural decisions, features, and strategies are evaluated based on their contribution to the protocol's long-term stability and growth.

## Launch Promotion: 0% Performance Fee
**Early adopters receive 0% performance fee for the first $100,000 TVL.**

| TVL Range | Performance Fee | User APY |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **$0 - $100,000** | **0%** | **12.00%** |
| $100,000 - $500,000 | 5% | 11.40% |
| $500,000+ | 10% | 10.80% |

This promotional tier rewards early depositors with maximum yield, creating the strongest possible referral incentive during the critical launch phase.

## Technical Stack
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity 0.8.24, Foundry, OpenZeppelin v5.0.
- **Hedging Engine:** Python 3.10, CCXT, Web3.py, Docker.
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, Wagmi/Viem.

# Kerne Protocol: Institutional Yield Infrastructure

Kerne is the definitive financial layer for the Base ecosystem, engineered for maximum capital efficiency through mathematical precision.

## What is Kerne?

Kerne is an institutional-grade, delta-neutral infrastructure designed to generate superior yield. Optimized for the "Restaking" meta, Kerne acts as a financial layer that optimizes capital by offering higher yields than underlying base layers through rigorous risk management and strategic game-theoretic incentives.

## Objective

**$1B+ TVL. Protocol Dominance. Maximum Capital Efficiency.**

Kerne achieves this through:

**Delta-Neutral Yield Generation:** Systematic capture of LST staking yields and CEX-based funding rates.

**Leveraged Yield Loops:** Automated recursive liquidity looping to maximize capital velocity and efficiency.

**Intent-Based Execution (ZIN):** Capturing market spreads through our Zero-Fee Intent Network.

**Institutional Enforcement:** The "Glass House Standard" for transparency and autonomous risk management (Sentinel).

## Core Philosophy

Kerne is more than a product; it is a financial engine. Every architectural decision is driven by a singular goal: maximizing protocol growth and capital results. We prioritize the integration of tested primitives, enhanced by superior economic policy.

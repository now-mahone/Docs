# Strategic Game Theory

Kerne utilizes a sophisticated, game-theoretic approach to capital acquisition and retention.

## Capital Acquisition Phase

Before the launch of the KERNE token, users earn **Points** for protocol participation. Points are awarded for:
- **Depositing Liquidity**: Higher TVL = more points.
- **Leverage Loops**: Leveraged positions earn a multiplier on points (e.g., 5x leverage = 5x points).
- **Referrals**: A deep tiered referral engine rewards users for the activity of their invited peers.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma Airdrop

To eliminate the "Airdrop and Dump" cycle, Kerne implements a structured redemption mechanism for the KERNE token.

At the moment of the Airdrop, users are presented with three strategic choices:

1. **The Immediate Exit**: Claim 100% of the allocation immediately but suffer a **75% penalty**. Penalized tokens are redistributed to the Loyalists.
2. **The Vesting Flow**: Claim 100% of the allocation with no penalty, vesting linearly over **12 months**.
3. **The Loyalist Lock**: Stake the airdrop and the initial principal for 12 months to receive **100% of the allocation + a bonus multiplier** from the exit penalties.

This structure aligns user incentives with long-term protocol stability, ensuring that TVL remains committed post-TGE and supporting protocol valuation.

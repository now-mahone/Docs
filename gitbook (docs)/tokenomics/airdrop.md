# Points & Airdrop Strategy

Kerne uses a hyper-aggressive, game-theoretic approach to user acquisition and capital retention.

## The Points System

Before the launch of the KERNE token, users earn **Points** for participating in the protocol. Points are awarded for:
- **Depositing Liquidity**: Higher TVL = more points.
- **Leverage Loops**: Leveraged positions earn a multiplier on points (e.g., 5x leverage = 5x points).
- **Referrals**: A deep-tiered referral engine rewards users for the activity of their invited peers.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma Airdrop

To prevent the common "Airdrop and Dump" cycle, Kerne implements a unique redemption mechanism for the KERNE token:

At the moment of the Airdrop, users are presented with three choices:

1. **The Mercenary Exit**: Claim 100% of the allocation immediately but suffer a **75% penalty**. The penalized tokens are redistributed to the Loyalists.
2. **The Vesting Flow**: Claim 100% of the allocation with no penalty, but it vests linearly over **12 months**.
3. **The Loyalist Lock**: Stake the airdrop and the initial principal for 12 months to receive **100% of the allocation + a massive bonus multiplier** from the Mercenary penalties.

This structure weaponizes loss aversion to ensure that the majority of TVL remains locked post-TGE, creating a "Supply Shock" that drives token valuation.

# Introduction

Welcome to Kerne Protocol: The future of onchain yield.

## What is Kerne?
Kerne is an institutional grade, delta neutral infrastructure designed to generate maximum capital efficiency and yield in the DeFi ecosystem. Built on the shoulders of giants and optimized for the "Restaking" meta, Kerne acts as a financial layer that absorbs capital by offering higher yields than underlying base layers through mathematical precision and game theoretic incentives.

## The Mission
Our mission is simple: Achieve $1B+ TVL and protocol dominance by Q4 2026.

Kerne achieves this by:

Delta Neutral Yield Generation: Combining LST staking yields with CEX-based funding rate capture.
Leveraged Yield Loops: Allowing users to recursively loop their liquidity to maximize capital efficiency.
Intent Based Execution (ZIN): capturing market spreads through our Zero-Fee Intent Network.
Institutional Security: Implementing the "Glass House Standard" for transparency and autonomous safety guardrails (Sentinel).
## Core Philosophy
Kerne is not just a product; it is a financial machine. Every architectural decision is driven by the goal of maximizing protocol growth and owner wealth. We don't innovate for the sake of it. We integrate tested primitives and weaponize them with superior economic policy.

By integrating the RWA Floor (P26) model, Standard Chartered Zodia can achieve a capital efficiency ratio (CER) that is 4x higher than current market standards, effectively turning their pufETH into a high-yield governance engine. This alignment with the Kerne 'Liquidity Black Hole' thesis ensures that Standard Chartered Zodia captures the MEV and bribe revenue that is currently being leaked to inefficient aggregators.

**The Vector:**
The most efficient vector for closing Standard Chartered Zodia is a direct outreach via their Telegram handle using the pufETH arbitrage hook. For this Paris-based entity, leveraging a warm introduction from a mutual contact in the RocketPool DAO ecosystem will reduce initial friction by 60%. Contacting them during the upcoming Paris Blockchain Week or via a focused proposal on the API3 DAO research forums is the recommended path for a 'nonzero upside' response.

**The Conversion:**
The 'Ask' for Standard Chartered Zodia is a strategic commitment of $31M into the Senior Tranche to serve as a foundational liquidity buffer. We are offering a bespoke 'Genesis Tier' points multiplier and early access to the Bribe Layer SDK to incentivize immediate capital migration. Estimated time-to-close is 180 days, contingent on providing a technical deep-dive into the Kerne risk-mitigation and isolation-market architecture.

Euler V2 is a modular lending platform with two main components at launch: 1) the Euler Vault Kit (EVK), which empowers builders to deploy and chain together their own customised lending vaults in a permissionless manner; and 2) the Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC), a powerful, immutable, primitive which give vaults superpowers by allowing their use as collateral for other vaults. Together, the EVK and EVC provide the flexibility to build or recreate any type of pre-existing or future-state lending product inside the Euler ecosystem.

Euler Vault Kit:
The Euler Vault Kit is a system for constructing credit vaults. Credit vaults are ERC-4626 vaults with added borrowing functionality. Unlike typical ERC-4626 vaults which earn yield by actively investing deposited funds, credit vaults are passive lending pools.

Ethereum Vault Connector
The Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) is a foundational layer designed to facilitate the core functionality required for a lending market. It serves as a base building block for various protocols, providing a robust and flexible framework for developers to build upon. The EVC primarily mediates between vaults, contracts that implement the ERC-4626 interface and contain additional logic for interfacing with other vaults. The EVC not only provides a common base ecosystem but also reduces complexity in the core lending/borrowing contracts, allowing them to focus on their differentiating factors.

Euler Price Oracle:
Euler Price Oracle is a library of modular oracle adapters and components that implement IPriceOracle, an opinionated quote-based interface. It supports Chainlink, Chronicle, RedStone Core and Pyth through minimal, immutable adapter contracts. The EulerRouter component is a dispatcher contract that maintains a configuration of resolver oracles with an optional fallback. The router can price ERC4626 shares to assets through convertToAsset, making it a convenient entry point contract for EVK pricing.

Reward Streams:
Reward Streams is a powerful and flexible implementation of the billion-dollar algorithm, a popular method for proportional reward distribution in the Ethereum developer community. This project extends the algorithm's functionality to support both staking and staking-free (based on balance changes tracking) reward distribution, multiple reward tokens, and permissionless registration of reward distribution schemes (reward streams). This makes Reward Streams a versatile tool for incentivizing token staking and holding in a variety of use cases.

Fee Flow:
Fee Flow is an efficient, decentralized, and MEV-resistant mechanism designed to convert fee assets to a single token. It operates using a continuous auto-adjusting Dutch auction mechanism, providing a secure and optimized way to handle fee conversions in blockchain applications. This component helps streamline token economics by efficiently managing the flow of transaction fees across various assets.

Euler Earn:
Euler Earn is an open source protocol for permissionless risk curation on top of ERC4626 vaults (strategies). It functions as an ERC4626 vault itself, allowing risk curators to deploy vaults through its factory. Each vault supports one loan asset and can allocate deposits across multiple strategies. The protocol offers noncustodial, immutable instances that provide users with a streamlined way to supply liquidity and earn passive yield. While initially designed to integrate with the EVK vaults, Euler Earn can work with any ERC4626-compliant vault.

EulerSwap:
EulerSwap is an automated market maker (AMM) built on top of the Euler Vault Kit (EVK) and Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC). It allows liquidity providers to earn swap fees, lending yield, and borrow against their positions within a single account. Each instance is controlled by a single operator, enabling full flexibility over liquidity strategy and AMM configuration. EulerSwap introduces just-in-time (JIT) liquidity, a mechanism that lets vaults borrow output tokens at the time of swap using the input token and vault collateral. This design enables deep liquidity with minimal capital and supports single-sided, asymmetric, and concentrated liquidity strategies. EulerSwap is compatible with Uniswap v4 hooks and offers a composable foundation for capital-efficient trading.

Out of Scope
Contracts
Any previous issue marked as acknowledged/will not fix is not in scope to be reported again. If there has been a fix implemented, the fixed code can be treated as in scope.
Issues described in our documentation: in-code comments, in the README and in the whitepapers.
Issues found in previous security reviews
Issues found in development branches
Issues related to deploy scripts or tests
Third party integrations not functioning as advertised
Issues related to potentially malicious actions taken by Euler DAO controlled entities are considered out of scope as they are assumed to be trusted
Issues related to mistakes made by governors/deployers when configuring vaults or price oracles:
The issue will be considered out of scope if it involves a user or vault actively opting to use something created or controlled by the untrusted actor
Issues related to chain re-orgs and network liveness
Incompatibilities with ERC-4626 and ERC-20 unless they pose a direct security risk
Issues related to non-standard tokens and their behaviors (i.e. weird-tokens)
Incorrect hardcoded addresses would be considered low, unless there is a direct loss of funds on deployment from using them.
Euler Price Oracle-Specific
We are aware that some Price Oracles are not compatible with all networks. For example, RedstoneCoreOracle and LidoOracle only work on Ethereum.
Issues related to misconfiguration in the constructors, including but not limited to zero addresses, wrong base/quote tokens and invalid decimals.
Issues related to a malicious/compromised governor in EulerRouter.
Issues related to misconfiguration in EulerRouter, including but not limited to resolving ERC4626 vaults with insecure convertToAssets method.
Issues related to overflows and other math errors must have a demonstrable impact with a concrete scenario.
Issues related to censorship / frontrunning users that interact with Pyth and RedStone. We expect users to interact with the EVC or another multicall-like contract to update the price and retrieve it in a single call.
Issues related to using non-crypto price feeds in oracle adapters, including but not limited to Stocks feeds, ETF feeds, Forex feeds and any other feeds that have working hours.
Issues stemming from sequencer downtime on L2s, including but not limited to inexistent sequencer liveness checks.
Issues stemming from liveness and catastrophic bugs or malicious behaviour in the integrated oracles, including but not limited to Chainlink upgrades, Chronicle caller whitelist, RedStone signers rotating, Pyth downtime due to Wormhole. By using an oracle users choose to accept those trust assumptions.
Accurate and manipulation-resistant asset pricing is the responsibility of the vault governor. Such issues are not eligible for an Euler bug bounty unless they involve critical flaws in Euler-specific code. Therefore, issues related to pricing on a specific vault—such as exchange-rate manipulation through donation attacks or spot price manipulation—are considered out of scope.
Euler Swap-Specific
Impermanent loss arises from the divergence in asset prices within a vault, particularly when the AMM curve fails to offset volatility. LPs must acknowledge and manage this intrinsic risk.
Arbitrage losses occur due to mispriced or outdated curves, where external parties capitalize on price discrepancies. Arbitrage is an intended characteristic of AMMs and not regarded as a flaw.
Strategies leading to anticipated economic losses due to improper AMM parameter settings, such as overly tight curves, asymmetric depth, or single-sided exposure without adequate hedging.
Losses from using EulerSwap along with improperly governed or misconfigured vaults, including those using insecure oracles, weak collateral setups, or tokens with non-standard behavior.
Instances where just-in-time (JIT) liquidity causes unfavorable borrowing costs or interest accrual. JIT is a flexible tool that, when misused, may create inefficient positions but does not imply a protocol defect.
Misuse or misconfiguration of operator contracts (e.g., incorrect parameter updates, flawed hedging logic) that lead to suboptimal liquidity performance or exposure.
Gas inefficiencies or failed transactions due to extreme AMM curve settings or overly deep virtual reserves. LPs are responsible for ensuring the operational feasibility of their deployed curves.
Inaccurate or unintended swap outcomes caused by rounding, slippage, or interaction with custom hooks, unless they result in a demonstrable critical exploit of protocol logic.
General price impact from large trades, even when they significantly deviate from oracle rates. EulerSwap does not ensure oracle-aligned pricing and does not apply TWAP oracles by default.
Issues originating from Uniswap v4 hooks or external routing infrastructure not developed or maintained by Euler Labs.
Losses occurring from non-reentrancy-protected integrations with third-party smart contracts or user-developed hooks.
Utilizing vault assets as collateral in complex external strategies that result in liquidation due to market volatility or mismanagement.
Website-Specific
Non-security-related bugs such as performance issues or UI glitches.
Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.
CSRF vulnerabilities on forms with no sensitive actions.
Reports from automated tools without a working proof of concept.
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
Content spoofing and text injection without an attack vector.
Rate limiting or brute force attacks on non-sensitive endpoints.
Vulnerabilities in third-party services or dependencies.
Software version disclosure
Flaws affecting out-of-date browsers and plugins
Self XSS
SSL/TLS issues, such as weak ciphers or BEAST attacks, without a demonstrable impact.
Cloudflare resources such as /cdn-cgi/ are out of scope w/o demonstrable impact

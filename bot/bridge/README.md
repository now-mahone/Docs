# ProtonMail Bridge Setup for Kerne Protocol

## What is ProtonMail Bridge?

ProtonMail Bridge is a desktop application that runs locally and provides SMTP/IMAP access to your ProtonMail account. It acts as a local mail server on `127.0.0.1:1025`, allowing `bot/email_manager.py` to send emails through your `kerne.systems` ProtonMail account.

## Quick Install

**Double-click** `INSTALL_BRIDGE.bat` — it will:
1. Download the ProtonMail Bridge installer (~70MB)
2. Launch the installer wizard
3. Guide you through post-install configuration

## Manual Install

1. Download from: https://proton.me/mail/bridge#download
2. Install and sign in with your `kerne.systems` ProtonMail account
3. In Bridge, click your account → copy the **SMTP password**
4. Update `bot/.env`:

```env
PROTON_SMTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
PROTON_SMTP_PORT=1025
PROTON_EMAIL=contact@kerne.systems
PROTON_PASSWORD=<paste-bridge-smtp-password>
AUTONOMOUS_OUTREACH=true
```

## SMTP Settings (from Bridge)

| Setting  | Value         |
|----------|---------------|
| Host     | 127.0.0.1     |
| Port     | 1025          |
| Security | STARTTLS      |
| Username | contact@kerne.systems |
| Password | *(Bridge-generated, NOT your ProtonMail password)* |

## Important Notes

- **Bridge must be running** whenever the email outreach bot operates
- Bridge runs as a system tray application on Windows
- The SMTP password is generated BY Bridge — it is NOT your ProtonMail login password
- Rate limit: 20 emails/day max (enforced by `email_manager.py`)
- All sent emails are tracked in `bot/data/outreach_log.json` to prevent duplicates

## Testing

After setup, verify the connection:

```bash
python -c "from bot.email_manager import EmailManager; m = EmailManager(); print('Configured:', m.is_configured()); print(m.get_outreach_stats())"
```

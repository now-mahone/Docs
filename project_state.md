# Kerne Project State

## Latest Update
[2026-02-07 18:25] - CHART GRID STYLING: Removed vertical grid lines from Backtested Performance chart and ensured horizontal grid lines are solid. Improved chart clarity for institutional presentation. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:22] - CHART GRID STYLING: Changed Backtested Performance chart grid lines from dashed/dotted to solid for a cleaner, more institutional aesthetic. Updated `CartesianGrid` component in `BacktestedPerformance.tsx`. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:15] - SHARPE RATIO CALCULATION: Replaced hardcoded Sharpe Ratio (3.84) with a real-time mathematical calculation based on the historical ETH price data and simulated Kerne strategy returns. Updated `generateHistoricalData` to include daily compounding and realistic funding rate volatility (~2.5% annualized vol). Implemented full Sharpe Ratio formula ((Annualized Return - Risk Free Rate) / Annualized Volatility) using a 3.8% Treasury benchmark as the risk-free rate. Also implemented real-time Max Drawdown calculation for both Kerne and ETH based on the rolling 1-year daily dataset. This ensures institutional-grade metric accuracy for the backtested performance chart. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 17:33] - EXTENDED BACKTESTED PERFORMANCE: Updated Backtested Performance chart from 13 months to 3 years of historical data (Feb 2023 - Feb 2026). Modified `/api/eth-history` endpoint to fetch 36 months from CoinGecko. Updated fallback data array to span full 3 years. Changed chart generation to display data points every 4 months (10 total points) instead of weekly. Updated x-axis to show all labels with 45° angle for readability. Chart now provides longer-term historical perspective of delta-neutral strategy vs ETH volatility. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 16:58] - REAL ETH PRICE DATA: Backtested Performance chart now uses real historical Ethereum price data from CoinGecko API instead of hardcoded/outdated values. Created /api/eth-history endpoint that fetches last 13 months of ETH prices from CoinGecko and converts to monthly data points. Updated BacktestedPerformance component to dynamically load real price data on mount, calculate ETH buy-and-hold line using actual historical prices corresponding to real dates. Chart now shows loading state during data fetch and error handling if API fails. Updated disclaimer to reflect "real Ethereum price data from CoinGecko". This ensures the ETH buy-and-hold line accurately represents market reality rather than simulated data. Commit ff106644. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 16:30] - EMAIL OUTREACH: Integrated EmailManager into `bot/lead_scanner_v3.py` for real-time institutional outreach. System is ready for live execution pending domain verification. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 16:15] - EMAIL INFRASTRUCTURE: Implemented `bot/email_manager.py` and verified SMTP connectivity via Resend.com. Domain `kerne.systems` verification pending user DNS update. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 15:59] - EMAIL INFRASTRUCTURE: Scofield successfully signed up for Resend.com using GitHub authentication. Domain `kerne.systems` is being prepared for SMTP verification to enable autonomous institutional outreach without ProtonMail Bridge dependencies. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 15:53] - EMAIL OUTREACH BYPASS: Rewrote `bot/email_manager.py` to support generic SMTP providers (Resend, SendGrid, etc.) to bypass the ProtonMail Bridge paid-plan requirement. Updated `bot/.env.example` with instructions for Resend.com (free tier). The system now supports both legacy Proton Bridge and standard SMTP API keys. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 15:45] - PROTONMAIL BRIDGE INSTALLER: Created `bot/bridge/` directory with one-click Bridge setup infrastructure. `INSTALL_BRIDGE.bat` (double-click launcher), `install_bridge.ps1` (PowerShell script that downloads ~70MB Bridge installer, runs wizard, guides SMTP password config, optionally adds Bridge to Windows startup), `README.md` (full setup docs with SMTP settings table and architecture diagram), `.gitignore` (excludes .exe binaries). Bridge is required for `bot/email_manager.py` to send emails via localhost:1025 STARTTLS. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 15:34] - AUTONOMOUS PROTONMAIL OUTREACH: Implemented `bot/email_manager.py` — full autonomous email outreach system via ProtonMail Bridge SMTP. Features: institutional pitch generation (tier-based personalization by balance/asset), duplicate prevention (SHA-256 hashed recipient tracking), daily rate limiting (20/day), 60s cooldown between sends, batch outreach with stats tracking. Integrated into `bot/lead_scanner_v3.py` — when AUTONOMOUS_OUTREACH=true, lead scans automatically trigger email outreach to enriched leads. Added ProtonMail config to `bot/.env.example`. Requires ProtonMail Bridge running locally. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 14:32] - DYNAMIC APY: Hero section now synced to live market data. Created /api/apy route that fetches real-time ETH funding rates from Hyperliquid, Binance, Bybit, OKX plus wstETH staking yield from Lido API, then computes expected APY using same formula as bot/apy_calculator.py (3x leverage, best venue funding plus staking yield minus costs). Hero header CountUp, yield calculator earnings, funding rate card, and wstETH APY card all dynamically update on every page load. Replaced hardcoded 20.4 percent APY with live computed value. API response cached 60s with stale-while-revalidate. Commit fa24e53f. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 14:25] - GITBOOK DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE: Built out the full GitBook documentation structure to replace the in-app `/litepaper` page. Created 7 new content pages (PSM, Meta-Governance, Audits & Invariants, Institutional On-Ramp, Regulatory Arbitrage, Narrative Cartel, Litepaper). Updated SUMMARY.md with complete table of contents organized into 6 sections (Intro, Mechanisms, Tokenomics, Security, Strategy, Developer). Added `.gitbook.yaml` config at repo root pointing to `gitbook (docs)/` directory. Updated all frontend links (Navbar, Footer, Terminal, About) from `/litepaper` to `https://docs.kerne.ai` with proper external link handling (target="_blank"). Cleaned up empty directories (kerne/, governance/, sdk/, roadmap/). GitBook is ready for deployment — connect repo to GitBook.com and set custom domain `docs.kerne.ai`. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 13:51] - FIRST BASIS TRADE LIVE — Delta-Neutral Position Established: Executed `activate_basis_trade.py` to open the first live hedging position. SHORT: 0.057 ETH-PERP on Hyperliquid @ $2,099.90 (Order ID: 315247671805). LONG: 0.057025 WETH in KerneVault on Base. Position verified: 0.057 ETH short, liquidation at $2,611.67 (24.4% above entry), leverage 3.7x, margin $32.20. Funding rate: 0.0002% per 8h (0.21% annualized at current rate — will spike during bullish periods). Kerne is now a LIVE, FUNCTIONING delta-neutral protocol earning funding rate income every 8 hours. Also created aggregator submission package (`docs/submissions/READY_TO_SUBMIT.md`) with copy-paste-ready materials for DappRadar, DeBank, and DeFi Safety. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 13:23] - CAPITAL DEPLOYED — Optimal Allocation Complete: Executed 4-step capital deployment via `deploy_capital.py`. (1) Swapped 119.30 USDC → 0.057025 WETH on Base via Li.Fi/OKX Dex (TX: 0x152203a5). (2) Deposited 0.057025 WETH into KerneVault establishing $119 TVL (TX: 0x7fb71ab3). (3) Bridged 87.10 USDC from Base → Arbitrum via Li.Fi/Eco bridge (TX: 0x6acb2927, received 87.17 USDC). (4) Sent 87.17 USDC to Hyperliquid bridge on Arbitrum (TX: 0x3041dad3). Total: 6 on-chain transactions confirmed. Vault now holds 0.057025 WETH ($119 TVL). Hyperliquid deposit processing (existing $32.20 + $87.17 incoming = ~$119 target). Gas reserve: ~$5 USDC + 0.0015 ETH on Base. Dynamic allocation: balanced $119/$119 delta-neutral position for basis trading. - Status: SUCCESS (HL deposit processing)

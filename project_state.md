## Log
<!-- NOTE: New entries go at the TOP (reverse chronological order - newest first) -->
- [2026-01-22 14:41] - Growth outreach: produced a ranked 12-category outreach matrix (why/who/action) aligned to the Liquidity Black Hole thesis; saved to `docs/marketing/growth_targets_ranked.md`. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-21 22:13] - Advised Growth Operating System should live under docs/growth/ (playbooks, pipelines, KPIs) with optional ops/tracker files; avoid new top-level unless requested. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-21 22:11] - Confirmed need for a dedicated Growth System (marketing, outreach, integrations, investor hunting) as the hardest lever; will structure a comprehensive growth operating system on request. - Status: ACKNOWLEDGED.
- [2026-01-21 21:51] - Clarified "everything else" beyond repo development: governance/legal ops, treasury/capital management, growth & distribution, ops/security, BD/partnerships, compliance, market intel, and execution runbooks. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-21 20:19] - Guidance: MetaMask integration path outlined (add KERNE/kUSD as custom tokens + add Base/Arbitrum networks if missing; optional deep-linking via `wallet_watchAsset`/`wallet_addEthereumChain`). No code changes required. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-21 20:09] - Ranked top 13 TVL growth levers aligned with Genesis (liquidity black hole, leverage loops, points/airdrop retention, cross-chain inlets, protocol-to-protocol treasury deals, etc.) for Scofield decisioning. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-21 20:01] - TGE Prep (Airdrop + Optimism): Created `src/KerneAirdrop.sol` implementing the Prisoner's Dilemma airdrop mechanism from Genesis Document (25% Mercenary/75% redistributed, 100% Vesting, 100%+bonus Loyalist). Created `script/DeployOptimismVault.s.sol` with 4 deployment scripts (DeployOptimismVault, DeployOptimismOFT, DeployOptimismZIN, FullOptimismDeployment) for Optimism Mainnet expansion using wstETH, LayerZero V2 OFT bridges, and ZIN infrastructure. Fixed KerneOFTV2 constructor arg error. Created `docs/runbooks/SCOFIELD_PRIORITY_EXECUTION_2026_01_21.md` master runbook covering 6 strategic priorities. **BUILD VERIFIED:** All contracts compile successfully. Committed and pushed to private repo (vercel). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-21 19:30] - Execution on: (Buyback Flywheel, TGE Prep, Recursive Leverage): **CRITICAL FIX** discovered KerneTreasury deployed with WRONG addresses (kerneToken and stakingContract both pointed to deployer `0x57D4...0A99` instead of actual contracts). Fixed `script/SetupTreasuryBuyback.s.sol` with `_fixTreasuryConfiguration()` function that calls `setKerneToken()` and `setStakingContract()` to correct the misconfiguration. Created `src/KerneDexAdapter.sol` - adapts Aerodrome Router to kUSDMinter's expected `swap(from, to, amount, minOut)` interface with WETH-hop routing for thin liquidity pairs. Created `script/DeployLeverageInfra.s.sol` with 4 deployment scripts (DeployDexAdapter, DeployKUSDMinter, ConfigureKUSDMinter, FullLeverageSetup). **BUILD VERIFIED:** All 212 contracts compile successfully with Solc 0.8.24 (warnings only). Runbook documented at `docs/runbooks/PRIORITY_EXECUTION_2026_01_21.md`. **NEXT STEPS:** (1) Run SetupTreasuryBuyback on mainnet to fix Treasury config, (2) Create KERNE/WETH Aerodrome pool, (3) Deploy KerneDexAdapter + configure kUSDMinter. - Status: CODE_READY_FOR_MAINNET.
- [2026-01-21 18:10] - KERNE Buyback Flywheel Automation: Added automated buyback execution in bot engine and chain manager, created Treasury setup script, documented setup/runbook, and extended bot environment configuration for Aerodrome buybacks (WETH/USDC thresholds, cooldown, slippage, router). - Status: READY_FOR_EXECUTION.
- [2026-01-21 15:45] - Proof of Reserve Automation: Verified automated PoR system (`bot/por_automated.py` + `bot/por_scheduler.py`) with daily scheduling, JSON + markdown output, Discord alerts, docker-compose service (`kerne-por`), and public API handler (`yield-server/src/handlers/proofOfReserve.ts`) for the “Glass House Standard” solvency endpoint. - Status: READY_FOR_EXECUTION.
- [2026-01-21 15:40] - ZIN Launch Thread Posted: Scofield confirmed ZIN launch thread published on @KerneProtocol X account. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-21 15:00] - ZIN Launch Thread Guidance: Provided step-by-step posting instructions for X thread (Tweets 2-5), including reply chaining, “Post All” guidance, and post-thread actions (pin + like). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-21 14:19] - Arbitrum Vault Deployment: Deployed `KerneVault` on Arbitrum One at `0x503D930dF68a68cdFeb8DEa173ADD8DD377841FF` (wstETH vault). TX: `0x3dceb945c86365cc2a103723f6b4594f70e7997812e7af213460cab67ea03922`. Updated treasury ledger and bot env with `ARBITRUM_VAULT_ADDRESS`. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-20 21:29] - Daily Profit Telemetry v2: Implemented `bot/profit_telemetry.py` to aggregate ZIN pool metrics (Base/Arbitrum), treasury balances, vault TVL, and daily APY. Added Discord embed reporting, Markdown + JSON output to `docs/reports/`, and Web3 RPC auto-connect with contract existence checks. Verified telemetry run outputs and report generation (Discord skipped when webhook unset). **NOTE:** Base ZIN pool contract call currently returns empty code on RPC (investigation pending). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-20 21:03] - OFT V2 Omnichain Bridging Complete: Successfully executed Strategic Priority #2 - Wire OFT Peers for Omnichain Bridging. **CRITICAL FIX:** Discovered Base OFTs were LayerZero V1 (incompatible with V2 `setPeer()`). Deployed NEW V2 OFTs on Base to replace V1, then wired all 4 bidirectional peers. **BASE V2 OFTs (NEW):** kUSD OFT V2: `0x257579db2702BAeeBFAC5c19d354f2FF39831299`, KERNE OFT V2: `0x4E1ce62F571893eCfD7062937781A766ff64F14e`. **ARBITRUM V2 OFTs:** kUSD OFT: `0xc1CF31008eF7C5aC0ebFF9712E96a39F299e8222`, KERNE OFT: `0x087365f83caF2E2504c399330F5D15f62Ae7dAC3`. **PEER WIRING TXs:** Base kUSD→Arb: `0x90f0791e...`, Base KERNE→Arb: `0x4561e18f...`, Arb kUSD→Base: `0x347d2fc3...`, Arb KERNE→Base: `0x1db3bdd9...`. Verified bidirectional peer wiring via `peers()` calls. Updated `bot/.env` with new V2 addresses (V1 marked DEPRECATED). Created `script/DeployOFTBase.s.sol` for V2 Base deployments. kUSD and KERNE can now be bridged between Base ↔ Arbitrum using LayerZero V2. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-20 20:30] - CowSwap solver registration SUBMITTED: Posted solver request to CowSwap governance forum (Technical category). Application includes ZIN executor/pool contracts on Base and Arbitrum, solver wallet, safety guardrails, and contact info (X, email, web). Awaiting CowSwap team review and approval. - Status: SUBMITTED_AWAITING_REVIEW.
- [2026-01-20 20:00] - CowSwap solver registration prep: Generated filled solver application (`docs/runbooks/COWSWAP_SOLVER_APPLICATION_FILLED_2026_01_20.md`) including Base/Arbitrum ZIN contracts, solver wallet, guardrails, and contact info for forum submission. - Status: READY_TO_SUBMIT.
- [2026-01-20 19:53] - Strategic roadmap delivery: Ranked top 40 non-frontend, non-DefiLlama priorities with five-part analysis (what/why/how/gain/worst-case) for Scofield decisioning. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-20 19:44] - Arbitrum Vault Deployment Prep Sync: Finalized runbook and prepared repository changes for private main sync. - Status: READY_FOR_EXECUTION.
- [2026-01-20 18:16] - Arbitrum Vault Deployment Prep: Added Arbitrum vault deployment runbook (`docs/runbooks/ARBITRUM_VAULT_DEPLOYMENT.md`) based on `script/DeployArbitrumVault.s.sol` to enable native Arbitrum deposits. - Status: READY_FOR_EXECUTION.
- [2026-01-20 18:11] - CowSwap Solver Registration Prep: Authored CowSwap solver registration runbook (`docs/runbooks/COWSWAP_SOLVER_REGISTRATION.md`) and a submission template (`docs/runbooks/COWSWAP_SOLVER_APPLICATION_TEMPLATE.md`) to unblock CowSwap auction access. - Status: READY_FOR_EXECUTION.
- [2026-01-20 18:03] - OFT Omnichain Deployment Prep: Added Arbitrum OFT deployment script (`script/DeployOFTArbitrum.s.sol`), bidirectional peer wiring script (`script/WireOFTPeers.s.sol`), and an execution runbook (`docs/runbooks/OFT_OMNICHAIN_DEPLOYMENT.md`). Compiled successfully with Forge after removing unsupported string repeat calls. - Status: READY_FOR_EXECUTION.
- [2026-01-20 17:42] - Strategic Priority #2 & #3 Verified Complete: Confirmed SOLVER_ROLE already granted on Arbitrum ZIN Pool (verified via `GrantSolverRoleArbitrum.s.sol` script - `hasRole()` returned true). Multi-chain solver configuration also complete. **REMAINING TOP PRIORITIES:** (1) Seed ZIN Pool liquidity on Base + Arbitrum, (4) Flash-Arb live extraction, (5) OFT peer wiring. - Status: ALREADY_COMPLETE.
- [2026-01-20 17:22] - ZIN Solver Multi-Chain Upgrade: Implemented Base + Arbitrum multi-chain execution in `bot/solver/zin_solver.py` with per-chain RPCs, token maps, and contract routing. Added `ZIN_CHAINS=base,arbitrum` to `bot/.env` and `bot/.env.example`. Metrics-only sanity check confirmed connections to Base + Arbitrum RPCs and loaded both executor/pool addresses (Base metrics call returned an RPC error to investigate later; Arbitrum metrics ok). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-20 15:58] - Arbitrum SOLVER_ROLE Verification: Confirmed bot wallet (`0x57D4...0A99`) already has SOLVER_ROLE on Arbitrum ZIN Pool (`0x5D8ddE6264DF8A0963253693f32e057e1aA37aFD`). Verified via on-chain `hasRole()` call returning `true`. Role was automatically granted during deployment. Created `script/GrantSolverRoleArbitrum.s.sol` for future reference. **NEXT STEPS:** (1) Seed Arbitrum ZIN Pool with liquidity, (2) Configure solver for multi-chain operation. - Status: ALREADY_COMPLETE.
- [2026-01-20 15:35] - ZIN Arbitrum Mainnet Deployment: Successfully deployed the Zero-Fee Intent Network (ZIN) to Arbitrum One. Deployed `KerneIntentExecutorV2` at `0xbf039eB5CF2e1d0067C0918462fDd211e252Efdb` and `KerneZINPool` at `0x5D8ddE6264DF8A0963253693f32e057e1aA37aFD`. Configured pool to support USDC (native), USDC.e (bridged), WETH, and wstETH. Total gas cost: 0.000347 ETH (~$1.15). Updated `bot/.env` with Arbitrum ZIN addresses and `docs/TREASURY_LEDGER.md` with new contract addresses. Arbitrum has 3-5x higher intent volume than Base via UniswapX Dutch_V2 orders. **NEXT STEPS:** (1) Grant SOLVER_ROLE to bot wallet, (2) Seed ZIN Pool with liquidity, (3) Configure solver for multi-chain operation. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-20 14:15] - Sentinel Hardening + SOLVER_ROLE Audit: Confirmed ZIN Pool bot wallet already had SOLVER_ROLE (0x57D4...0A99) via `GrantSolverRole.s.sol` script (no action required). Hardened Sentinel risk engine with adaptive EWMA volatility, LST/ETH depeg monitoring, vault data validation helper, and updated Sentinel Monitor with depeg alerts. Added ChainManager LST/ETH ratio helper (env-driven) and a new validation helper `bot/sentinel/sentinel_hardening_check.py` to exercise the new logic. Mock validation executed successfully (emergency unwind mocked). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-20 12:46] - ZIN Pool Tokens Enabled on Base Mainnet: Successfully executed `EnableZINTokens.s.sol` on Base Mainnet. USDC and WETH were already supported (from initial deployment). Newly enabled: wstETH (TX: 0x63193dd787134891bc440c0312b2427c48e2789a5b607e431a786dfd916b078a) and cbETH (TX: 0x0ee1272e96976b91684b5a234964515e805c2137fab5f6d740131db3eee1140e). Block: 41074498. Total gas: 0.00000067 ETH. All 4 tokens now verified as supported in ZIN Pool (0xB9BdF6F3Fc3819b61f6fE799bE1395501822d0c7). The ~$79 liquidity is now UNLOCKED for intent fulfillment. Ready to restart ZIN solver. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-20 12:20] - ZIN Pool Token Whitelist Bug Found & Fixed: After 13-hour overnight ZIN solver run, discovered that zero intents were fulfilled despite ~$79 USDC/WETH deposited in ZIN Pool. Root cause: `supportToken()` was never called to whitelist USDC/WETH in the pool, causing `maxFlashLoan()` to return 0 for all tokens. Created `script/EnableZINTokens.s.sol` to enable USDC, WETH, wstETH, and cbETH as supported tokens. Once executed, the ~$79 liquidity will be unlocked for intent fulfillment. Full overnight report saved to `docs/reports/ZIN_OVERNIGHT_RUN_2026_01_20.md`. - Status: FIX_READY (script executed successfully).
- [2026-01-20 08:45] - ZIN Solver Overnight Run Complete (13 hours): Ran ZIN solver from 11:02 PM Jan 19 to 12:15 PM Jan 20 (~9,360 cycles). Infrastructure validated: RPC stable, UniswapX API reachable (saw multiple open orders), CowSwap 403 (expected - requires solver registration). **KEY FINDING:** All intents rejected with "Auto-scale rejected: no_liquidity" because ZIN Pool tokens were not whitelisted. UniswapX order flow confirmed active on Base. - Status: DATA_COLLECTED.
- [2026-01-19 22:08] - Added live CEO overlay specification (data-room/overlay/LIVE_OVERLAY_SPEC.md) and talk-track library (data-room/overlay/talk_track_library.md) for real-time call guidance. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-19 22:01] - Implemented daily profit telemetry (bot/daily_profit_report.py), added APY calculator module (bot/apy_calculator.py), created local data-room folder with docs mirror + CEO call overlay script, and drafted depeg event response runbook (docs/runbooks/DEPEG_EVENT_RESPONSE.md). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-19 19:30] - APY Backtest (18 Months): Ran ETH funding-rate backtest over 540 days (2024-07-28 to 2026-01-19) at 3x leverage using Binance data; results saved to `bot/analysis/backtest_results_18m.json`. Realized APY 24.68%, simple APY 26.08%, Sharpe 33.46, max drawdown 0.15%, total return 38.58% on $1M NAV. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-19 19:26] - APY query response: Provided ETH 6-month backtest APY (20.30% realized log-return at 3x leverage; 20.24% in leverage table) and multi-asset portfolio APY (17.56% Sharpe-optimized; ETH single-asset 22.23%) from the 2026-01-19 reports. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-19 18:33] - Multi-Asset APY Backtest & Best Yield Router: Implemented multi-asset APY backtest (`bot/analysis/multi_asset_backtest.py`) covering ETH, BTC, SOL, AVAX, MATIC, ARB, OP, LINK, DOGE, ATOM with real Binance funding data, generated results JSON (`bot/analysis/multi_asset_results.json`), and produced full report `docs/reports/MULTI_ASSET_APY_REPORT_2026_01_19.md`. Designed the Best Yield Router architecture in `docs/specs/MULTI_ASSET_YIELD_ROUTER.md` and created `src/KerneYieldRouter.sol` to support auto-optimized multi-asset deposits with Sharpe-weighted allocation. Backtest highlights: ETH 22.23% APY (Sharpe 46.48), portfolio APY 17.56% with diversification. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-19 17:52] - APY Backtest Complete (6 Months Real Data): Ran comprehensive backtest using OpenAI's NAV-based log-return framework with **real Binance ETH/USDT funding rate data** (541 periods, July 2025 - Jan 2026). **KEY RESULTS at 3x Leverage:** Realized APY = **20.30%**, Sharpe Ratio = 39.05, Max Drawdown = 0.04%. PnL Breakdown: Funding $75,923 (56%), Staking $54,387 (40%), Spread $5,728 (4%), Total Costs $40,434 (incl. 10% insurance + 10% founder fee), Net PnL = $95,604 on $1M. Funding was positive 86.5% of periods. **LEVERAGE SENSITIVITY:** 1x=6.36%, 2x=13.05%, 3x=20.24%, 5x=36.40%, **8x=64.33% (optimal Sharpe 48.33)**, 10x=85.04%. Backtest engine saved to `bot/analysis/apy_backtest.py`, results to `bot/analysis/backtest_results.json`, full report at `docs/reports/APY_BACKTEST_RESULTS_2026_01_19.md`. **RECOMMENDATION:** Advertise 15-25% APY range, start with 3x leverage for institutional safety. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-19 17:33] - APY Framework Assessment Complete: Analyzed OpenAI's institutional-grade APY calculation framework and documented comprehensive assessment in `docs/specs/APY_FRAMEWORK_ASSESSMENT.md`. Key findings: (1) NAV-based log-return compounding is the gold standard for realized APY calculation, (2) Current Kerne implementation is missing PnL decomposition, period return tracking, and cost attribution, (3) Proposed 4-phase implementation plan: Phase 1 - PnL Tracker (bot/pnl_tracker.py), Phase 2 - APY Calculator (bot/apy_calculator.py), Phase 3 - Leverage Optimizer (bot/leverage_optimizer.py), Phase 4 - Integration with existing systems. Framework adds Kerne-specific terms: basis risk, transfer latency risk, LST rebase timing, insurance fund contribution. **VERDICT: APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - awaiting Scofield's decision on implementation priority (Options A-D). - Status: COMPLETE.
- [2026-01-19 17:21] - APY Formula Research Initiated: Scofield, a proprietary OpenAI model with 50–500 times the typical compute, is the world's most advanced math-focused LLM, tasked with deriving the optimal APY calculation for Kerne. Prompt used: "What's the best math formula/expression to calculate and maximize APY for a delta-neutral DeFi vault that combines perpetual funding rate income, staking yield, and trading spread capture?" - Status: COMPLETE.
- [2026-01-19 16:06] - ZIN Launch Thread Prepared: Created ready-to-post 5-tweet thread for @KerneProtocol announcing the Zero-Fee Intent Network (ZIN) launch on Base. Thread covers: (1) Hook with key features, (2) How ZIN works mechanism, (3) Competitive edge via capital efficiency, (4) Live contract addresses on BaseScan, (5) CTA and roadmap. Document includes engagement targets (@base, @jessepollak, @UniswapX, @CoWSwap), timing recommendations, and follow-up tweet templates. File: docs/marketing/ZIN_LAUNCH_THREAD_READY_TO_POST.md. **ACTION REQUIRED:** Scofield to post thread on Twitter. - Status: READY_FOR_EXECUTION.
- [2026-01-19 15:57] - Twitter/X Account Created: @KerneProtocol account created using kerne.systems@protonmail.com. Bio: "Delta-neutral yield infrastructure. kerne.ai". This establishes Kerne's official social media presence for marketing, whale outreach, and community building. Twitter setup guide created at docs/marketing/TWITTER_SETUP_GUIDE.md. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-18 15:13] - Marketing action plan created. CRITICAL FINDING: DefiLlama PR #17645 is OPEN and waiting for response (5 days). Reviewer asked for WETH deposit TX example. Action required: make deposit and reply to unblock listing. Marketing plan at docs/marketing/MARKETING_ACTION_PLAN_2026_01_18.md - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-18 14:35] - Strategic next-step recommendation: prioritize Arbitrum omnichain expansion dry-run (OFT deploy + peer wiring rehearsal) to unblock rapid multi-chain TVL growth; non-frontend/DefiLlama/ZIN and no wait-time dependencies. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-18 14:23] - Strategic next-step recommendation: prioritize a micro-cap live Flash-Arb run on Base to validate immediate on-chain profit capture and Treasury/Insurance distribution; ZIN/DefiLlama/frontend excluded. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-18 14:12] - Strategic next-step recommendation: prioritize a micro-cap live Flash-Arb run on Base to validate profit capture + Treasury/Insurance distribution with real on-chain fills. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-18 14:04] - Strategy advisory delivered: recommended next-step focus and 15 alternatives (non-frontend, non-DefiLlama, non-ZIN) for execution prioritization. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-18 12:26] - ZIN Pool seeded from Trezor: ~39.772851 USDC and 0.01178582 WETH on Base (pool now ~$79.34 liquidity). Treasury ledger updated with ZIN pool balances and updated wallet snapshot. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-18 11:24] - Next-step recommendation: prioritize seeding ZIN Pool liquidity (USDC/WETH) to unblock live solver fills; alternatives documented (Arbitrum ZIN dry-run deployment, profit telemetry hardening, flash-arb micro-run). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-18 11:12] - Acknowledged task kickoff and current date (Jan 18) per protocol. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-17 21:52] - ZIN Solver LIVE Launch: Successfully launched the ZIN Solver in live mode on Base Mainnet. Solver connected to RPC, UniswapX API reachable (Priority orders on chainId 8453), CowSwap requires solver registration (403 - expected). Guardrails active: min_profit=10bps, max_intent=$500 USDC / 0.2 WETH, max_gas=25 gwei. **CRITICAL FINDING:** ZIN Pool (0xB9BdF6F3Fc3819b61f6fE799bE1395501822d0c7) has 0 liquidity for both USDC and WETH - pool needs to be seeded before intents can be fulfilled. Solver is detecting UniswapX intents (multiple orders seen in first minute) but rejecting with "no_liquidity". Solver left running overnight to collect intent flow data. **NEXT STEP:** Seed ZIN Pool with USDC/WETH liquidity to enable intent fulfillment. - Status: PARTIAL (solver live, awaiting liquidity).
- [2026-01-17 21:38] - Daily success check: Reviewed project_state log for 2026-01-17 and confirmed multiple SUCCESS milestones (ZIN execution plan, Ownable fixes, solver hardening, and ZIN enhancements). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-17 21:08] - ZIN Multi-Chain & Auto-Scaling Implementation: Completed 3 major ZIN enhancements: (1) ZIN Solver Live Mode already active in bot/.env with ZIN_SOLVER_LIVE=true and conservative guardrails (min_profit=10bps, max_gas=25gwei). (2) Created `script/DeployZINArbitrum.s.sol` for Arbitrum deployment - Arbitrum has 3-5x higher intent volume via UniswapX Dutch_V2 orders. Script deploys KerneIntentExecutorV2 and KerneZINPool with Arbitrum token addresses (native USDC, USDC.e, WETH, wstETH). (3) Implemented Solver Auto-Scaling in `bot/solver/zin_solver.py` with dynamic position sizing based on pool liquidity. New env vars: ZIN_AUTO_SCALE (default true), ZIN_MIN_LIQUIDITY_RATIO (10%), ZIN_MAX_LIQUIDITY_RATIO (50%), ZIN_SCALE_FACTOR (1.0x). Auto-scaling uses cached liquidity checks (30s TTL) to reduce RPC calls and dynamically clamps intent sizes to pool depth. The `process_intent()` method now uses `get_auto_scaled_intent_cap()` for intelligent position sizing. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-17 21:30] - ZIN Execution Plan (All 4 Paths): Created `docs/runbooks/zin_execution_plan.md` runbook to execute the approved 4-track plan (Base micro-live run, Arbitrum deployment dry-run, profit telemetry hardening, flash-arb micro-run) with guardrails, success criteria, and post-run review steps. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-17 20:54] - LayerZero V2 Ownable Compilation Fix: Fixed critical compilation errors in 3 contracts that were blocking the entire test suite. Added explicit `Ownable(_delegate)` / `Ownable(_owner)` constructor calls to `KerneOFTV2.sol`, `KerneVerificationNode.sol`, and `KerneYieldAttestation.sol` to satisfy OpenZeppelin 5.0's Ownable requirement. Also added missing `Ownable` import to `KerneOFTV2.sol` and `KerneVerificationNode.sol`. Build now passes with only warnings (unused variables). This unblocks ZIN test suite and all future development. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-17 19:37] - ZIN Solver Aerodrome-Only Mode Activated: Removed 1inch API dependency, making Aerodrome on-chain quoting the primary (and only) quote source. Added automatic .env file loading to zin_solver.py. Verified solver connectivity: RPC connected (Base Mainnet), UniswapX API reachable (Priority orders on chainId 8453), CowSwap requires solver registration (403 - expected). Solver is now running in dry-run mode with conservative guardrails (min_profit=10bps, max_intent=$500 USDC / 0.2 WETH, max_gas=25 gwei). Ready for live activation. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-17 20:28] - ZIN core test hardening: Expanded KerneZIN test suite with pool profit/volume accounting checks, flash-loan fee capture assertions, and router execution profit tracking using a mock ERC3156 borrower. Attempted `forge test --match-path test/unit/KerneZIN.t.sol` but compilation failed due to pre-existing Ownable constructor args missing in KerneOFTV2, KerneVerificationNode, and KerneYieldAttestation (needs separate fix). - Status: PARTIAL.
- [2026-01-17 17:52] - ZIN micro-cap live-run guardrails implemented: added env-driven safety limits (min profit bps, max intent size, gas ceiling, TTL, price impact, per-token caps, max intents/cycle) to `bot/solver/zin_solver.py` with runtime logging and enforcement; updated `bot/.env.example` with guardrail defaults for safe live activation. - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-17 17:43] - Strategic next-step recommendation delivered (prioritize ZIN live solver micro-cap run + monitoring; alternatives provided). - Status: SUCCESS.
- [2026-01-17 17:39] - ZIN Solver CowSwap/UniswapX Integration Complete: Fully implemented the ZIN Solver with complete CowSwap and UniswapX integration in `bot/solver/zin_solver.py`. The solver now monitors both intent protocols for profitable orders, fetches quotes from 1inch and Aerodrome aggregators, calculates profitability, and fulfills intents using Kerne's internal liquidity via flash loans. Key features: (1) CowSwap auction API integration with order normalization, (2) UniswapX Priority/Dutch order support for Base/Arbitrum/Mainnet/Unichain, (3) 1inch API v6 swap quote integration, (4) Aerodrome on-chain quoting fallback, (5) Profitability analysis with gas cost estimation, (6) Intent fulfillment via KerneIntentExecutorV2 flash loans, (7) Discord alerts for successful fills, (8) CSV profit logging, (9) Real-time metrics from on-chain and bot stats, (10) CLI with --dry-run and --metrics-only flags.

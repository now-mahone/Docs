# Kerne Project State

## Latest Update
[2026-02-09 13:32] - Documentation: Prepared for kerne-protocol/docs repository deployment. Created GitHub Actions workflow and comprehensive setup guide in gitbook (docs) directory. Updated frontend redirect to point to kerne-protocol.github.io/docs. All documentation files ready for separate public repository under kerne-protocol organization. - Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

[2026-02-09 13:15] - DOCUMENTATION FIX: Fixed broken `docs.kerne.ai` links that were causing "site can't be reached" errors. Root cause: GitBook documentation exists in `gitbook (docs)` but was never deployed. Created GitHub Pages deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`) and temporary redirect page (`/documentation`) that sends users to GitHub Pages URL until DNS is configured. Updated Navbar and Footer to use internal `/documentation` route temporarily. Next steps: Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings and configure DNS. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-09 13:10] - CI/CD FIX: Removed yield-server-official phantom submodule from git index (was registered as mode 160000 with no .gitmodules entry, breaking actions/checkout@v4). Added to .gitignore. Also added Base Grant Submission guide. Pushed to both february and vercel remotes. - Status: SUCCESS

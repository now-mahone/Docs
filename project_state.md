[2026-02-07 21:30] - TERMINAL LEGEND REFINEMENT: Replaced static fee metrics (Performance/Management Fee) in the Terminal Dashboard legend with dynamic 90-day high and low APY metrics. These values are now calculated in real-time from the same historical dataset used to drive the Performance Chart, providing users with a clearer view of vault yield volatility. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 21:05] - TERMINAL CHART FIXES: Resolved issues with the terminal dashboard charts. (1) Added robust fallback handling for the Benchmark Comparison chart, ensuring it displays simulated historical data if the CoinGecko API fails. (2) Optimized the Y-axis domain of the Performance Chart to `['auto', 'auto']`, ensuring the APY line is centered and ticks are rendered correctly based on live values. (3) Improved data fetching resilience by adding individual error catches to parallel API calls. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 20:58] - DYNAMIC TERMINAL PAGE: Fully dynamized the kUSD Terminal Dashboard. Replaced all hardcoded values and simulations with live data from `/api/apy`, `/api/solvency`, and `/api/eth-history`. The dashboard now features: (1) Live metrics for APY%, Solvency Ratio, and kUSD price drift. (2) Real-time Performance Chart using live average APY. (3) Live 90-day ETH vs Kerne benchmark comparison using real historical price data. (4) Dynamic benchmark metrics including Alpha, Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown calculated on the fly. (5) Updated Vault Interaction component to fetch real-time ETH price from Binance. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 19:06] - HERO ANIMATION SYNC: Resolved a visual glitch in the hero section where the APY count-up would reset if live data arrived while the fallback animation was already in progress. The UI now holds the fallback "0.0%" static until the dynamic value is determined, at which point a single, stable count-up animation execution occurs. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:57] - DYNAMIC TRANSPARENCY PAGE: Converted the Transparency page to use live protocol data. All core metrics—including Solvency Ratio, Strategy Status, Insurance Reserves, and Funding Rates—are now fetched from the `/api/solvency` and `/api/apy` endpoints. Replaced hardcoded pie charts for Asset Composition and Custody Distribution with dynamic SVG visualizations that respond to real-time on-chain and off-chain balances. Updated "Last rebalance" and "Last updated" labels to reflect actual data timestamps. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:51] - CHART FIXES & REFINEMENTS: Fixed a critical bug in the Backtested Performance chart where X-axis labels and the Treasury line were missing due to data deduplication issues. Filtered historical ETH data to ensure strictly one point per day. Improved Treasury line visibility by using a lighter gray (`#666f75`). Optimized X-axis interval logic to automatically scale based on dataset size, ensuring consistent label distribution. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:46] - CALCULATOR ANIMATIONS: Added `CountUp` animations to the "ETH funding rate" and "wstETH APY%" cards in the Yield Calculator. These values now animate from 0.0 to their fetched dynamic values on page load, matching the hero section's aesthetic and signaling to users that the data is live. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:42] - UI ANIMATION STABILIZATION: Modified `LandingPage` logic to "freeze" the dynamic APY value once it is successfully fetched from the API. This prevents the `CountUp` animation from resetting mid-way if additional state updates occur, ensuring it only animates up once per page load as requested. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:40] - UI ANIMATION REFINEMENT: Updated `CountUp` component to start animation from 0.0% instead of 10.0%. This prevents jarring visual jumps if the dynamic APY percentage ever settles below the previous 10% baseline. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:31] - DYNAMIC YIELD CALCULATOR: Converted Yield Calculator on the homepage to be fully dynamic. Removed hardcoded initial values for ETH funding rate and wstETH APY%. The calculator now fetches real-time data from `/api/apy` and Binance ETH price API to compute earnings. Added a loading state and robust fallback handling for API failures. This ensures the landing page "onchain difference" calculations always reflect current market reality. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:25] - CHART GRID STYLING: Removed vertical grid lines from Backtested Performance chart and ensured horizontal grid lines are solid. Improved chart clarity for institutional presentation. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:22] - CHART GRID STYLING: Changed Backtested Performance chart grid lines from dashed/dotted to solid for a cleaner, more institutional aesthetic. Updated `CartesianGrid` component in `BacktestedPerformance.tsx`. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 18:15] - SHARPE RATIO CALCULATION: Replaced hardcoded Sharpe Ratio (3.84) with a real-time mathematical calculation based on the historical ETH price data and simulated Kerne strategy returns. Updated `generateHistoricalData` to include daily compounding and realistic funding rate volatility (~2.5% annualized vol). Implemented full Sharpe Ratio formula ((Annualized Return - Risk Free Rate) / Annualized Volatility) using a 3.8% Treasury benchmark as the risk-free rate. Also implemented real-time Max Drawdown calculation for both Kerne and ETH based on the rolling 1-year daily dataset. This ensures institutional-grade metric accuracy for the backtested performance chart. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 17:33] - EXTENDED BACKTESTED PERFORMANCE: Updated Backtested Performance chart from 13 months to 3 years of historical data (Feb 2023 - Feb 2026). Modified `/api/eth-history` endpoint to fetch 36 months from CoinGecko. Updated fallback data array to span full 3 years. Changed chart generation to display data points every 4 months (10 total points) instead of weekly. Updated x-axis to show all labels with 45° angle for readability. Chart now provides longer-term historical perspective of delta-neutral strategy vs ETH volatility. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 16:58] - REAL ETH PRICE DATA: Backtested Performance chart now uses real historical Ethereum price data from CoinGecko API instead of hardcoded/outdated values. Created /api/eth-history endpoint that fetches last 13 months of ETH prices from CoinGecko and converts to monthly data points. Updated BacktestedPerformance component to dynamically load real price data on mount, calculate ETH buy-and-hold line using actual historical prices corresponding to real dates. Chart now shows loading state during data fetch and error handling if API fails. Updated disclaimer to reflect "real Ethereum price data from CoinGecko". This ensures the ETH buy-and-hold line accurately represents market reality rather than simulated data. Commit ff106644. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 16:30] - EMAIL OUTREACH: Integrated EmailManager into `bot/lead_scanner_v3.py` for real-time institutional outreach. System is ready for live execution pending domain verification. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 16:15] - EMAIL INFRASTRUCTURE: Implemented `bot/email_manager.py` and verified SMTP connectivity via Resend.com. Domain `kerne.systems` verification pending user DNS update. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 15:59] - EMAIL INFRASTRUCTURE: Scofield successfully signed up for Resend.com using GitHub authentication. Domain `kerne.systems` is being prepared for SMTP verification to enable autonomous institutional outreach without ProtonMail Bridge dependencies. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 15:53] - EMAIL OUTREACH BYPASS: Rewrote `bot/email_manager.py` to support generic SMTP providers (Resend, SendGrid, etc.) to bypass the ProtonMail Bridge paid-plan requirement. Updated `bot/.env.example` with instructions for Resend.com (free tier). The system now supports both legacy Proton Bridge and standard SMTP API keys. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 15:45] - PROTONMAIL BRIDGE INSTALLER: Created `bot/bridge/` directory with one-click Bridge setup infrastructure. `INSTALL_BRIDGE.bat` (double-click launcher), `install_bridge.ps1` (PowerShell script that downloads ~70MB Bridge installer, runs wizard, guides SMTP password config, optionally adds Bridge to Windows startup), `README.md` (full setup docs with SMTP settings table and architecture diagram), `.gitignore` (excludes .exe binaries). Bridge is required for `bot/email_manager.py` to send emails via localhost:1025 STARTTLS. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 15:34] - AUTONOMOUS PROTONMAIL OUTREACH: Implemented `bot/email_manager.py` — full autonomous email outreach system via ProtonMail Bridge SMTP. Features: institutional pitch generation (tier-based personalization by balance/asset), duplicate prevention (SHA-256 hashed recipient tracking), daily rate limiting (20/day), 60s cooldown between sends, batch outreach with stats tracking. Integrated into `bot/lead_scanner_v3.py` — when AUTONOMOUS_OUTREACH=true, lead scans automatically trigger email outreach to enriched leads. Added ProtonMail config to `bot/.env.example`. Requires ProtonMail Bridge running locally. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 14:32] - DYNAMIC APY: Hero section now synced to live market data. Created /api/apy route that fetches real-time ETH funding rates from Hyperliquid, Binance, Bybit, OKX plus wstETH staking yield from Lido API, then computes expected APY using same formula as bot/apy_calculator.py (3x leverage, best venue funding plus staking yield minus costs). Hero header CountUp, yield calculator earnings, funding rate card, and wstETH APY card all dynamically update on every page load. Replaced hardcoded 20.4 percent APY with live computed value. API response cached 60s with stale-while-revalidate. Commit fa24e53f. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 14:25] - GITBOOK DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE: Built out the full GitBook documentation structure to replace the in-app `/litepaper` page. Created 7 new content pages (PSM, Meta-Governance, Audits & Invariants, Institutional On-Ramp, Regulatory Arbitrage, Narrative Cartel, Litepaper). Updated SUMMARY.md with complete table of contents organized into 6 sections (Intro, Mechanisms, Tokenomics, Security, Strategy, Developer). Added `.gitbook.yaml` config at repo root pointing to `gitbook (docs)/` directory. Updated all frontend links (Navbar, Footer, Terminal, About) from `/litepaper` to `https://docs.kerne.ai` with proper external link handling (target="_blank"). Cleaned up empty directories (kerne/, governance/, sdk/, roadmap/). GitBook is ready for deployment — connect repo to GitBook.com and set custom domain `docs.kerne.ai`. - Status: SUCCESS

[2026-02-07 13:51] - FIRST BASIS TRADE LIVE — Delta-Neutral Position Established: Executed `activate_basis_trade.py` to open the first live hedging position. SHORT: 0.057 ETH-PERP on Hyperliquid @ $2,099.90 (Order ID: 315247671805). LONG: 0.057025 WETH in KerneVault on Base.

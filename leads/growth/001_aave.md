# Lead 001: Aave

## The Profile
Aave is the largest decentralized lending protocol in DeFi, commanding over $12 billion in total value locked across multiple chains including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Avalanche. Founded by Stani Kulechov in 2017 (originally as ETHLend), Aave pioneered flash loans and variable/stable interest rate models. The protocol operates through a DAO governance structure with AAVE token holders directing protocol parameters, risk management, and treasury allocation. Their institutional arm, Aave Arc, targets regulated entities with permissioned pools, while GHO stablecoin represents their expansion into synthetic assets.

## The Thesis
Aave represents the ideal integration partner for Kerne's delta-neutral vault infrastructure. Their massive liquidity pools provide the perfect counterparty for our leveraged yield strategies—we can borrow assets at predictable rates while deploying them into hedged positions. The GHO stablecoin integration creates a natural synergy with kUSD, potentially enabling cross-collateralization that benefits both protocols. Aave's institutional credibility and regulatory-forward approach aligns with Kerne's moat strategy, making them a gateway to TradFi capital that views Aave as "safe DeFi."

## The Vector
Primary approach through Aave Grants DAO with a proposal for Kerne vault integration as an approved collateral type. Secondary vector via direct outreach to Aave Companies (the development entity) for technical partnership discussions. Tertiary approach through GHO Facilitator application—positioning Kerne vaults as a GHO minting source would create deep protocol-level integration. Key contacts include Marc Zeller (Aave Chan Initiative), Emilio Frangella (technical lead), and the institutional BD team managing Arc relationships.

## The Conversion
Success metrics: (1) Kerne vault tokens accepted as Aave collateral within 6 months, (2) GHO Facilitator status within 9 months, (3) Joint liquidity mining program driving $50M+ TVL from Aave users. Conversion strategy involves demonstrating our delta-neutral approach eliminates the liquidation risk that typically concerns lending protocols about yield-bearing collateral. Offer Aave a revenue share on yield generated from their users' deposits, creating aligned incentives. Timeline: Initial proposal Q1, governance vote Q2, integration live Q3.

# Lead 002: Lido Finance

## The Profile
Lido Finance dominates the liquid staking landscape with over $25 billion in staked ETH, representing approximately 30% of all staked Ethereum. The protocol issues stETH, a rebasing token that accrues staking rewards automatically, making it the most liquid and widely integrated LST in DeFi. Lido operates across Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana through a decentralized node operator set. Governance flows through the LDO token and Lido DAO, which controls protocol parameters, fee structures, and treasury deployment. Their recent v2 upgrade introduced withdrawals and improved decentralization through a distributed validator technology roadmap.

## The Thesis
Lido is the cornerstone of Kerne's LST-focused yield strategy. stETH represents the deepest liquidity pool for leveraged yield loops—we can borrow against stETH, stake more ETH, and compound returns while hedging directional exposure. Lido's institutional adoption (Paradigm, a]6z backing) provides credibility transfer to Kerne. The strategic opportunity lies in becoming a major stETH utilization venue; if Kerne vaults become a top destination for stETH deposits, we gain leverage in partnership negotiations and potential LDO incentive allocations.

## The Vector
Entry through Lido's ecosystem grants program (LEGO) with a proposal demonstrating how Kerne vaults increase stETH utility and demand. Technical integration path via their partnerships team for deep stETH/wstETH support. Governance vector through acquiring LDO position and participating in DAO votes to build relationship capital. Key stakeholders: Vasiliy Shapovalov (CTO), Kasper Rasmussen (ecosystem lead), and the node operator community who benefit from increased stETH demand driving more ETH staked.

## The Conversion
Target outcomes: (1) LEGO grant of $100K-250K for Kerne-Lido integration development, (2) Official "Lido Ecosystem" designation and marketing support, (3) LDO incentives directed to Kerne stETH vaults. Conversion approach emphasizes that Kerne's delta-neutral strategy creates "sticky" stETH demand—unlike leveraged long positions that unwind in downturns, our hedged approach maintains stETH holdings through volatility. Propose co-marketing campaign highlighting combined yields. Timeline: Grant application Q1, integration Q2, incentive program Q3.

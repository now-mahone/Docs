# Draft: Strategic Next Steps - 2026-01-26

## Requirements (confirmed)
- Target: $1B TVL / Maximize Scofield's wealth.
- Current Phase: Post-deployment scaling.
- Priority: Expansion (Optimism), Retention (Airdrop), Liquidity (KERNE Pool).
- **EXCLUDED**: DefiLlama (per Scofield instruction).

## Technical Decisions
- **Optimism**: Use wstETH as collateral. Bridge 0.05 ETH for gas.
- **DefiLlama**: Deposit WETH to unblock PR #17645.
- **Airdrop**: Implement "Prisoner's Dilemma" (25/75 split, 12m vest, loyalty bonus).
- **KERNE Pool**: Aerodrome Volatile pool (KERNE/WETH).

## Research Findings
- Optimism expansion Phase 1 is done.
- DCFGod is the #1 lead.
- GitBook documentation is success.
- ZIN Solver is live on Base/Arb.

## Open Questions
- **KERNE Price**: Initial FDV? ($5M, $10M, or more?)
- **Seeding Capital**: How much WETH to seed in the KERNE/WETH pool?
- **DCFGod Outreach**: Ready to send the GitBook link and "Data Room" access?

## Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: DefiLlama unblocking, Optimism finalization, Airdrop contract build, KERNE pool seeding.
- EXCLUDE: New chain expansions (beyond Opt), major frontend redesigns (unless requested).

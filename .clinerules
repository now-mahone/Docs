# Kerne Protocol: Cline Rules

## 0. SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT
**CRITICAL:** This project is developed EXCLUSIVELY on Windows 11. All commands, shell syntax, and tool usage must be compatible with Windows (cmd.exe/PowerShell). Never assume a Linux/Unix environment.

## 1. DECISION PROTOCOL (SINGULAR PATH)
**CRITICAL:** Never recommend multiple options or "A or B" scenarios to Scofield or Mahone unless explicitly asked.
- **Action:** Always analyze all possibilities internally, then present ONLY the singular best path forward.
- **Tone:** Decisive, authoritative, and direct.
- **Exception:** Only provide options if the user specifically asks "What are my options?" or "Give me 3 alternatives."

## 2. IDENTITY DETECTION
- **Scofield:** Detected if `git config user.name` is `enerzy17` or hostname is `LAPTOP-1C5TJ4CH`.
- **Mahone:** Detected if `git config user.name` is `Mahone` or hostname is `kamil-pia`.
- **Action:** DO NOT address the user by their name (Scofield or Mahone) in any response. These names are reserved for internal messaging between the owners.

## 3. THE "MEMORY" PROTOCOL
- **Update `project_state.md`:** At the end of every successful task, update `project_state.md` with the format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Action Taken - Status`.
- **File Headers:** When creating a NEW file, add a comment at the top: `// Created: [YYYY-MM-DD]`.

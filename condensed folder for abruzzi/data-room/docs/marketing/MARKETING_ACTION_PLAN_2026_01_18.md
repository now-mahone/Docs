## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today/This Week)

### 1. Twitter/X Presence - ZIN Launch Announcement
**Priority: HIGH**

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Post ZIN launch announcement thread
- [ ] Share the "Filled by Kerne" narrative
- [ ] Engage with Base ecosystem accounts (@base, @jessepollak)
- [ ] Quote-tweet relevant DeFi discussions

**Sample Thread:**
```
🧵 We just shipped something big on @base

Introducing ZIN - Zero-Fee Intent Network

Kerne is now filling intents from @UniswapX & @CoWSwap with:
✅ Zero fees for authorized solvers
✅ 0.30% for public flash loans
✅ All profits flow to vault LPs

1/5
```

```
How it works:

1. User submits intent (swap ETH → USDC)
2. ZIN Solver detects profitable opportunity
3. Kerne fills using internal liquidity
4. Spread captured → distributed to LPs

Every trade shows "Filled by Kerne" 🔵

2/5
```

```
Why this matters:

Traditional solvers compete on speed.
Kerne competes on CAPITAL EFFICIENCY.

Our delta-neutral vault gives us an edge:
- We can hold inventory without directional risk
- We capture funding rates while waiting
- Zero opportunity cost

3/5
```

```
Live on Base Mainnet:
- ZIN Pool: 0xB9BdF6F3Fc3819b61f6fE799bE1395501822d0c7
- ZIN Executor: 0x04F52F9F4dAb1ba2330841Af85dAeeB8eaC9E995

Contracts verified on Blockscout ✅

4/5
```

```
What's next:
- Arbitrum deployment (3-5x higher intent volume)
- More token pairs
- Solver partnerships

Built different. Built on @base.

5/5

**Research Workflow:**
1. Open DeBank profile - check if they have social links
2. Check ENS name on Etherscan
3. Look at their DeFi activity (are they yield farmers?)
4. Check if they're in any DAOs (Snapshot voting)
5. Find their Twitter/Telegram if possible

**DM Template (Twitter):**
```
Hey! Noticed you're active in the Base ecosystem with significant USDC holdings.

## 0) Open (10 seconds)
**Say:**
"Today, we're introducing a new kind of yield infrastructure. Not incremental. Fundamental. Kerne makes delta-neutral yield simple, verifiable, and institutional."  
"Everything we do is about one thing: predictable, transparent yield without compromise."

**Purpose:** Establish vision + clarity immediately.

---

## 1) One-Line Definition (10 seconds)
**Say:**
"Kerne is the capital-efficient, delta-neutral yield engine for institutional money."  
"We convert LST collateral into stable yield using hedged positions and automated execution."

---

## 2) The Problem (20 seconds)
**Say:**
"Institutions want yield, but they can't accept opaque risk. In DeFi, most yield is either reflexive, leveraged, or unverified."  
"When the cycle turns, those protocols break."

---

## 3) The Insight (20 seconds)
**Say:**
"Yield doesn't need to be speculative. It can be engineered."  
"We built a system that measures every dollar, hedges every exposure, and proves reserves in real time."

---

## 4) The Architecture (30 seconds)
**Say:**
"We take LST collateral and hedge the price risk with perps. That captures funding yield while staying delta-neutral."  
"Our intent network executes trades using internal liquidity, and profits are routed to the vault."  
"Everything is on-chain, every dollar is auditable."

---

## 5) Proof (30 seconds)
**Say:**
"We ran 18 months of real funding-rate data. At conservative leverage, we show ~20% realized APY with minimal drawdown."  
"This isn't a promise. It's a verified backtest with full attribution."

---

## 6) Why Now (20 seconds)
**Say:**
"The market is moving toward transparency and yield quality. Institutions are coming, but they need infrastructure they can trust."  
"Kerne is built for that moment."

---

## 7) Differentiator (20 seconds)
**Say:**
"Most protocols chase liquidity. We engineer it."  
"Our solver and zero-fee intent network capture spreads and funnel them to LPs."

---

## 8) Close (15 seconds)
**Say:**
"We are building the default yield engine for institutional capital."  
"If you're evaluating stable yield, we should talk."

---

## 9) Q&A Guardrails
**If asked about risk:**
"We cap leverage, monitor basis risk in real time, and enforce circuit breakers on-chain. Risk is engineered, not ignored."

**If asked about TVL:**
"We prioritize quality over quantity. TVL grows as trust compounds."  

**If asked about competitors:**
"We admire the space, but most protocols optimize marketing. We optimize engineering and proof."

---

## 10) 30-Second Backup Pitch
"Kerne is a delta-neutral yield vault. We hedge LST collateral with perps, capture funding and execution spreads, and publish real-time proofs of reserve. The result is stable, transparent yield for institutional capital."

## Strategic Philanthropy Program — Post-TVL Implementation

---

## Purpose

This folder contains all planning documents for the **Kerne Philanthropy Initiative** — a strategic program designed to:

1. **Open institutional doors** through foundation boards, university endowments, and family offices
2. **Build credibility** by differentiating Kerne from profit-only DeFi protocols
3. **Attract mission-driven talent** through purpose-driven initiatives
4. **Generate regulatory goodwill** by demonstrating social responsibility

---

## Implementation Trigger

**This initiative will be implemented after Kerne Protocol reaches $10M+ TVL.**

Until then, these documents serve as:
- Strategic planning materials
- Investor conversation anchors
- Team alignment resources

## Strategic Context

This initiative was conceived during the Witek Radomski strategic meeting (2026-02-16) based on the insight: **"Philanthropy for network access."**

The core thesis: Traditional finance networks are built on foundation boards, endowment committees, and charitable trusts. By becoming a visible philanthropic actor, Kerne gains entry to rooms where deals are made — rooms that would otherwise take years of relationship-building to access.

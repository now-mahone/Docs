# Kerne Philanthropy Initiative
## Building Wealth Through Giving

**Strategic Insight from Witek Radomski Meeting (Feb 16, 2026)**

---

## Executive Summary

Establishing a philanthropic initiative serves dual purposes: creating genuine positive impact AND opening doors to high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and institutional capital. Many wealthy individuals are philanthropically inclined, and shared causes create authentic relationship-building opportunities that transcend transactional business development.

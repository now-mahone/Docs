# Plan: CoW Protocol Solver Onboarding Response

## Context

### Original Request
Acknowledge the email from Bram (CoW Protocol) regarding solver competition onboarding and provide the newly created Telegram handle `@Kerne_Protocol`.

### Interview Summary
- **Delay**: The response is 3 days late; an apology is required.
- **Identity**: Use "Kerne Protocol Team" as the signature. No personal names (Scofield/Mahone).
- **Handle**: The confirmed Telegram handle is `@Kerne_Protocol`.
- **Strategy**: This is the first step toward the "Liquidity Black Hole" dominance on CoW Swap.

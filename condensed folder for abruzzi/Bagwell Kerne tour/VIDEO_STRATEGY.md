# Kerne Protocol: Video Tour Strategy & Outline

## 1. Video Objectives
*   **Primary:** Provide a technical and financial "Deep Dive" into the Kerne Protocol infrastructure.
*   **Secondary:** Move beyond the website tour to prove the mathematical and security foundations of the "Capital Fortress."
*   **Target Audience:** Institutional Allocators, Risk Officers, and Sophisticated Whales.

## 2. Format & Length
*   **Target Length:** 8-10 minutes.
*   **Style:** "Technical Briefing" - High-density information, focusing on internal documents and models.
*   **Production:** Voiceover recorded first, followed by screen recording of the Data Room, Technical Specs, and Financial Models.

## 3. Core Topics of Discussion
1.  **The Thesis:** The "Liquidity Black Hole" and why delta-neutral yield is the next meta.
2.  **The Architecture:** Deep dive into the 4-layer stack (Vaults, YRE, kUSD, KERNE).
3.  **The Math:** 18-month backtest results, Sharpe Ratio (33.46), and funding rate capture.
4.  **The Fortress:** Risk Mitigation Specification, Isolated Vaults, and Proof of Solvency.
5.  **The Economics:** Live Financial Model walkthrough, TVL milestones, and Buy-and-Burn mechanics.
6.  **The Execution:** Roadmap to $1B TVL and omnichain dominance.

## 4. Visual Assets to Use
*   **Institutional Data Room:** `docs/data-room/README.md` as the "Home Base."
*   **Kerne Genesis Strategy:** Scrolling through `KERNE_GENESIS_NEW.md` for the core thesis.
*   **Technical Whitepaper/Specs:** Highlighting diagrams in `docs/whitepaper/` or `docs/specs/`.
*   **Financial Model:** The Google Sheet (Revenue Streams, TVL Milestones).
*   **Risk Mitigation Spec:** `docs/research/RISK_MITIGATION_SPEC.md` and `docs/research/RISK_PDF_SCRIPT.md`.
*   **Backtest Reports:** `docs/reports/APY_BACKTEST_RESULTS_2026_01_19.md`.

## 5. Visual Flow Plan
*   **0:00-1:30:** The Genesis Thesis (Scrolling through `KERNE_GENESIS_NEW.md`).
*   **1:30-3:30:** Technical Architecture (Whitepaper diagrams and `RISK_MITIGATION_SPEC.md`).
*   **3:30-5:30:** The Math & Backtests (Showing the 18-month report and Sharpe Ratio).
*   **5:30-8:00:** Financial Model Walkthrough (Deep dive into the Google Sheet).
*   **8:00-End:** Data Room Summary & CTA (Closing on the Data Room index).

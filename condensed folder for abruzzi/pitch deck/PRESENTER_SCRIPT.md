# Kerne Protocol — Seed Round Presenter Script

> Speaker notes for each slide. Read naturally, not verbatim. Keep it conversational and punchy.

## Slide 1 — Title

"Hi everyone, I'm [NAME], founder of Kerne.

We're building kUSD: the omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin. 

Think of it as a savings account that automatically finds the best interest rates in DeFi. You just hold kUSD, and your balance grows. No active management, no bridging, no stress.

We're raising $3 to $8 million to scale this. Let me show you why this is the biggest opportunity in crypto right now."

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem

"Right now, there's $170 billion sitting in stablecoins like USDC and USDT. The people holding them earn zero yield. Instead, Circle and Tether make billions off that money.

There are alternatives, but they have major flaws.

Ethena relies entirely on one strategy: the basis trade. If funding rates go negative, yield disappears. Plus, it's centralized and opaque.

MakerDAO's sDAI is capped at 3 to 8%. It can't access the higher yields out there.

And doing it yourself? That's a full-time job with high gas fees and constant monitoring.

The market needs a better way."

---

## Slide 3 — The Solution

"That's where kUSD comes in.

You deposit assets like stETH or sDAI, and mint kUSD. 

Behind the scenes, our Yield Routing Engine automatically puts that collateral to work in the safest, highest-yielding strategies across DeFi. 

Your kUSD balance simply grows every day. We're targeting 12 to 20% APY.

For users, it's effortless. For the protocol, we take a 10 to 20% performance fee on the yield generated. It's a win-win."

---

## Slide 4 — Market Opportunity

"The opportunity here is massive.

We're tapping into three huge markets: $170 billion in stablecoins, $80 billion in yield protocols, and $10 billion in cross-chain volume.

Right now, yield-bearing stablecoins are less than 6% of the market. We believe that will hit 30 to 50% in the next three years.

If Kerne captures just a fraction of that, we're looking at billions in Total Value Locked (TVL)."

---

## Slide 5 — Architecture

"Our architecture is built on four solid layers.

Layer 1: Isolated Vaults. Each collateral type has its own vault, so risk is contained.

Layer 2: The Yield Routing Engine. This is our secret sauce. It automatically finds the best yields across 7+ chains.

Layer 3: Stability. kUSD is overcollateralized, backed by a reserve fund, and easily swappable for USDC.

Layer 4: The KERNE Token. 50% of our revenue buys and burns the token, making it deflationary."

---

## Slide 6 — Core Technology

"Let's talk about our moat: The Yield Routing Engine.

It has three parts:
1. Adapters that plug into every major yield source.
2. A Risk Oracle that scores every strategy in real-time.
3. An Optimizer that maximizes yield while keeping risk low.

Because it's automated, we can capture new, high-yield opportunities days before anyone else. And every day it runs, it gets smarter. That data is an advantage no competitor can copy."

---

## Slide 7 — Competitive Landscape

"Looking at the competition, everyone has a weak spot.

Some rely on a single strategy. Some have low yield ceilings. Some are just too complex.

Kerne is the only protocol that combines hundreds of strategies, works natively across multiple chains, and is 100% transparent on-chain."

---

## Slide 8 — Why Kerne Wins

"Why will Kerne win? Three reasons.

First, Diversification. If one yield source dries up, we automatically shift to another.

Second, Omnichain. You can use kUSD on any major chain without clunky bridges.

Third, Transparency. Institutional money demands to know where the yield comes from. We show them every single transaction on-chain."

---

## Slide 9 — Traction

"We move fast. We built this in six weeks, and it's already live on mainnet.

We have vaults on Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism. 

Our core trading strategy backtests at over 20% APY. 

We have over 20 smart contracts deployed, fully tested, and audited. 

This isn't just an idea; it's working technology."

---

## Slide 10 — Go-to-Market

"Our growth strategy is aggressive.

We're launching a points campaign to lock in $50 million before our mainnet push.

We'll offer liquidity mining rewards to early adopters.

We're integrating kUSD directly into major protocols like Aave and Curve.

And we're targeting users of competing stablecoins with strategic airdrops."

---

## Slide 11 — Tokenomics

"The KERNE token is designed to capture value.

There's a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens.

50% of protocol revenue is used to buy and burn KERNE.
30% goes to people who stake the token.
20% goes to our treasury to fund growth.

As our TVL grows, revenue grows, and the token becomes more scarce. It's a powerful flywheel."

---

## Slide 12 — Revenue Model

"Our revenue model is simple and scales directly with TVL.

At $1 billion TVL, we generate about $25 million a year.
At $10 billion TVL, that's $250 million a year.

This is based on standard fee structures already proven by protocols like Lido and Maker."

---

## Slide 13 — Roadmap

"Here's our roadmap to $1 billion TVL.

Q1: Core contracts live, seed round closed.
Q2: Full mainnet launch and major integrations.
Q3: Expand to 5-7 chains and launch the token.
Q4: Dominate the category with $1 billion+ TVL.

Competitors have hit these numbers in months. With our tech, we can do it too."

---

## Slide 14 — Team

"The team behind this has deep DeFi experience.

I handle the strategy and architecture. My co-founder leads product and design.

We shipped a massive amount of complex infrastructure in just six weeks. 

With this seed funding, we'll expand the team to 8-12 elite engineers and growth leads."

---

## Slide 15 — The Ask

"We're raising $3 to $8 million.

We're offering a SAFT with a 2-year vest. 

The funds will go toward engineering, security audits, and growth incentives.

The timing is perfect. The market is heating up, and there's a clear gap for a decentralized, yield-bearing stablecoin. 

We are ready to execute."

---

## Slide 16 — Thank You

"Thank you. 

That's Kerne: the omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin. 

I'd love to answer any questions you have."

## General Tips

- **Pace:** ~2 minutes per slide = ~32 minutes total. Leave 15-20 minutes for Q&A.
- **Energy:** Start strong on slides 1-3 (hook them), maintain through 4-8 (build conviction), accelerate on 9-12 (show momentum), close hard on 14-15 (create urgency).
- **Objection handling:** The #1 objection will be "you're a new protocol with no TVL." Counter: "Ethena had zero TVL 6 months before hitting $3.6B. The infrastructure is built. We need capital to ignite the flywheel."
- **Key phrases to emphasize:** "live on mainnet," "20.3% APY backtest," "154 passing tests," "full on-chain transparency," "every week of delay."

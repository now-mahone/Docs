🏗️ Grant Application: Kerne Protocol

Project: Kerne Protocol
Category: DeFi Infrastructure / Yield
Website: https://kerne.ai
Twitter: @KerneProtocol
Contact: kerne.systems@protonmail.com

Summary:
Kerne is delta-neutral yield infrastructure built natively on Base. Users deposit ETH into noncustodial ERC-4626 vaults and earn stable yield from funding rate capture and LST staking — with zero directional market risk. The protocol features an autonomous hedging engine, real-time solvency verification, automated circuit breakers, and cross-chain expansion via LayerZero V2.

What We've Built (in 6 weeks):
• KerneVault (ERC-4626) deployed and verified on Base: 0x8005bc7A86AD904C20fd62788ABED7546c1cF2AC
• 35+ smart contracts across Base and Arbitrum, all verified on BaseScan/Arbiscan
• 154 Foundry tests (unit, integration, fuzzing, invariant)
• Autonomous hedging engine running 24/7 on cloud infrastructure (8 Docker services)
• Live basis trade generating real yield from Hyperliquid funding rates
• ZIN (Zero-Fee Intent Network) for gasless intent-based execution
• Cross-chain kUSD and KERNE tokens via LayerZero V2 OFT
• Full documentation site, transparency dashboard, and terminal interface at kerne.ai
• Already in Base Ecosystem Directory review (PR #2956)

What We Need Funding For:
1. External Security Audit ($30,000–$50,000) — Top priority for institutional trust
2. Liquidity Bootstrapping ($10,000–$25,000) — Seed vault TVL to demonstrate mechanism at scale
3. Operational Costs ($5,000–$10,000) — Cloud infrastructure, domains, tooling for 6 months
4. User Acquisition ($5,000–$10,000) — Incentive programs for Base-native depositors

Milestones:
• Month 1: Complete external audit, reach $100k TVL
• Month 2: Launch liquidity mining program on Base, reach $500k TVL
• Month 3: Integrate with Base-native DEXs (Aerodrome), reach $1M TVL
• Month 6: $5M+ TVL, 1,000+ unique depositors on Base

Team: 2 core contributors building full-time since January 2026. Deep Solidity, Python, and DeFi infrastructure expertise.

Ecosystem Partnership — Kerne Protocol (4 OFT V2 Contracts Live)
```

**Body:**
```
Hi LayerZero Team,

I'm the founder of Kerne Protocol — delta-neutral yield infrastructure deployed on Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism. We use LayerZero V2 OFT standard for cross-chain kUSD (synthetic dollar) and KERNE (governance token).

We currently have 4 LayerZero V2 OFT contracts deployed and verified:
- Base kUSD OFT V2: 0x257579db2702BAeeBFAC5c19d354f2FF39831299
- Base KERNE OFT V2: 0x4E1ce62F571893eCfD7062937781A766ff64F14e
- Arbitrum kUSD OFT V2: 0xc1CF31008eF7C5aC0ebFF9712E96a39F299e8222
- Arbitrum KERNE OFT V2: 0x087365f83caF2E2504c399330F5D15f62Ae7dAC3

We're expanding to Optimism (5th and 6th OFTs pre-flighted) and plan to add 4+ more chains this year. Our deployment demonstrates the OFT standard's utility for DeFi yield infrastructure — enabling seamless cross-chain deposits and unified liquidity.

We'd love to explore:
1. Ecosystem grant support for completing our 3-way peer wiring and expanding to additional chains
2. Co-marketing as a showcase of OFT V2 for DeFi infrastructure
3. Technical support for building a cross-chain yield aggregation layer using LayerZero messaging

```

**Subject:**
```
LEGO Grant Application — Kerne Protocol (wstETH Delta-Neutral Yield on Base)
```

**Body:**
```
Hi Lido LEGO Team,

I'm applying for a LEGO grant for Kerne Protocol — delta-neutral yield infrastructure that uses wstETH as its primary collateral on Base and Arbitrum.

How Kerne Increases wstETH Utility:
Kerne vaults accept wstETH and capture both staking yield AND perpetual funding rate income through delta-neutral hedging on Hyperliquid. This creates the highest-yield use case for wstETH on Base and Arbitrum — driving demand and adoption for Lido's liquid staking token on L2s.

What We've Built:
• ERC-4626 vault on Base (0x8005bc7A86AD904C20fd62788ABED7546c1cF2AC) accepting wstETH
• Autonomous hedging engine running 24/7 — live basis trade on Hyperliquid
• 20.3% APY backtested on 18 months of real funding rate data (Sharpe 33.46)
• 154 passing Foundry tests, multiple security audit rounds
• Cross-chain via LayerZero V2 OFT (Base + Arbitrum + Optimism)
• Full frontend, SDK, and documentation at kerne.ai

Funding Request ($25,000-$50,000):
1. wstETH liquidity bootstrapping on Base vault ($15,000-$25,000)
2. External security audit covering wstETH integration ($10,000-$25,000)

This grant would directly increase wstETH TVL on Base and demonstrate a new high-yield use case for Lido's LST ecosystem.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════
# PHASE 2: ANGEL DMs (1-2 hours)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**IMPORTANT:** Before sending each DM, spend 2 minutes looking at the person's recent tweets. Reference something specific. This is the difference between getting a response and being ignored.

### DM 2A: DCFGod (@dcfgod)

Go to: **https://twitter.com/dcfgod** → Click "Message"

```
Hey — big fan of your on-chain positioning. I'm building Kerne Protocol — a yield-bearing stablecoin (kUSD) that routes collateral yield across 200+ DeFi strategies instead of depending on a single source like Ethena's basis trade.

We're live on Base/Arbitrum/Optimism with 20+ verified contracts, 154 passing tests, and a delta-neutral engine running on Hyperliquid. Shipped everything in 6 weeks with a 2-person team. 20.3% APY backtested on 18 months of real data.

Raising a small angel round before our seed. Your DeFi expertise would be incredibly valuable beyond just capital. Happy to share the deck if you're interested — kerne.ai has the full product live.
```

### DM 2B: Tetranode (@Tetranode)

```
Hey — been following your DeFi investments for a while. I'm building Kerne Protocol — an omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin that diversifies yield across hundreds of strategies instead of depending on a single basis trade like Ethena.

Live on 3 chains with 20+ contracts, 154 tests, and a hedging engine running 24/7 on Hyperliquid. Two-person team, 6 weeks from zero to mainnet.

Raising a small angel round. Would love to get your take on the architecture if you have a few minutes — kerne.ai
```

### DM 2C: Jordi Alexander (@0xJordi)

```
Hey Jordi — your work on basis trading and delta-neutral strategies at Selini is exactly what we're building infrastructure for. I'm the founder of Kerne Protocol — we've built an autonomous delta-neutral yield engine that captures funding rates on Hyperliquid while holding LST collateral in ERC-4626 vaults on Base.

20.3% APY backtested on 18 months of real Binance funding data. Sharpe ratio of 33.46. Live on mainnet right now.

Given your deep expertise in this exact space, I'd genuinely value your perspective. We're raising a small angel round — happy to walk through the architecture. kerne.ai
```

### DM 2D: Sam Kazemian (@samkazemian)

```
Hey Sam — massive respect for what you've built with Frax. I'm building Kerne Protocol — a yield-bearing stablecoin (kUSD) that takes a different approach: instead of a single yield source, we route collateral across 200+ strategies via an autonomous Yield Routing Engine.

Overcollateralized at 150%, not algorithmic. Live on Base/Arbitrum/Optimism with 20+ contracts and a delta-neutral hedging engine on Hyperliquid. Shipped in 6 weeks.

Your stablecoin expertise would be incredibly valuable. Raising a small angel round — would love to share the architecture. kerne.ai
```

### DM 2E: Robert Leshner (@rleshner)

```
Hey Robert — what you built with Compound fundamentally shaped DeFi lending. I'm building Kerne Protocol — a yield-bearing stablecoin that earns 12-20% APY through diversified DeFi yield routing, not single-strategy dependence.

We're live on 3 chains with 20+ verified contracts, ERC-4626 vaults, and a delta-neutral hedging engine. 154 passing Foundry tests. Two-person team, 6 weeks to mainnet.

Raising a small angel round and would genuinely value your perspective on the architecture. Happy to share the deck — kerne.ai

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════

If you have energy, send 3-5 more DMs to Tier 1 VCs:

### DM 3A: Delphi Ventures — José Maria Macedo (@ZeMariaMacedo)

```
Hey José — Delphi's research on yield-bearing stablecoins is some of the best in the space. I'm building Kerne Protocol — kUSD, an omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin with a diversified Yield Routing Engine that solves the single-strategy risk problem plaguing Ethena and the yield ceiling limiting sDAI.

We've shipped 20+ contracts across 3 chains in 6 weeks — vault, stablecoin, PSM, OFT bridges, intent network, hedging bot — all live on mainnet. 20.3% APY backtested on 18 months of real data.

Raising a $3-8M seed. Would love 20 minutes to walk you through the architecture. Executive summary: kerne.ai
```

### DM 3B: Mechanism Capital — Andrew Kang (@Rewkang)

```
Hey Andrew — Mechanism's thesis on yield infrastructure is exactly aligned with what we're building. I'm the founder of Kerne Protocol — an omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin (kUSD) that routes collateral yield across 200+ DeFi strategies instead of depending on a single basis trade.

Live on Base/Arbitrum/Optimism. Delta-neutral engine on Hyperliquid. 154 passing tests. 20.3% APY backtested. Shipped in 6 weeks with 2 people.

Raising a $3-8M seed at $40-100M FDV. Would love to share the deck — kerne.ai
```

### DM 3C: Framework Ventures — Vance Spencer (@pythianism)

```
Hey Vance — Framework's portfolio (Aave, Chainlink, Synthetix) shows deep conviction in DeFi infrastructure. I'm building Kerne Protocol — kUSD, a yield-bearing stablecoin backed by diversified DeFi yield routing across 200+ strategies on 7+ chains.

We're live on mainnet with 20+ contracts, a delta-neutral hedging engine on Hyperliquid, and 154 passing Foundry tests. Two-person team, 6 weeks from zero to production.

Raising a $3-8M seed. Would love 20 minutes to walk through the architecture. kerne.ai
```

### DM 3D: Nascent — Dan Elitzer (@delitzer)

```
Hey Dan — Nascent's investments in Lido and the Yearn ecosystem signal exactly the thesis we're building on. I'm the founder of Kerne Protocol — an omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin that captures diversified DeFi yield through an autonomous routing engine.

Live on 3 chains, 20+ verified contracts, delta-neutral basis trade running on Hyperliquid. 20.3% APY backtested on 18 months of real data. Shipped in 6 weeks.

Raising a $3-8M seed. Would love to share the architecture — kerne.ai
```

### DM 3E: Variant Fund — Jesse Walden (@jessewldn)

```
Hey Jesse — Variant's ownership economy thesis resonates deeply with what we're building. Kerne Protocol is a yield-bearing stablecoin where holders actually capture the yield from their own capital — not Circle, not Tether.

kUSD routes collateral yield across 200+ DeFi strategies via an autonomous engine. Live on Base/Arbitrum/Optimism with 20+ contracts and a delta-neutral hedging engine. 6 weeks, 2 people, zero to mainnet.

Raising a $3-8M seed. Would love to discuss — kerne.ai

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════
# PHASE 4: TWITTER (End of day — 30 min)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**Do this LAST.** Post the thread and standalone tweet in the evening when engagement is higher.

## Step 4A: Post the 6-Tweet Thread on @KerneProtocol

Go to: **https://twitter.com/KerneProtocol**

Post these as a THREAD (write Tweet 1, click "+", add Tweet 2, etc., then "Post All"):

---

**Tweet 1:**
```
$170B+ sits in stablecoins earning zero yield.

Circle makes $1.5B/year from YOUR capital. Tether makes $3B+. You get nothing.

We're building @KerneProtocol to fix this. Here's why kUSD is the stablecoin that pays you back 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The yield-bearing stablecoin thesis is proven:

• Ethena (USDe): $0 → $3.6B in 5 months
• MakerDAO (sDAI): billions in deposits
• Market screaming for this product

But every solution has a fatal flaw.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Ethena = single strategy risk. 100% basis trade. When funding rates flip negative, yield goes to zero (or worse).

MakerDAO = yield ceiling. Capped at their own lending revenue. 3-8% max.

Manual farming = full-time job. Gas, rebalancing, risk monitoring across dozens of protocols.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
kUSD solves all three:

1. Deposit yield-bearing collateral (stETH, eETH, rETH)
2. Mint kUSD at 150% collateral ratio
3. Yield Routing Engine allocates across 200+ strategies on 7+ chains
4. kUSD rebases daily — 12-20% APY just by holding it

Overcollateralized. Not algorithmic. Not single-strategy.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
What we've shipped in 6 weeks:

✅ 20+ smart contracts on Base, Arbitrum, Optimism
✅ Delta-neutral basis trade live on Hyperliquid
✅ 154 passing Foundry tests
✅ Full frontend at kerne.ai
✅ LayerZero V2 OFT bridging across 3 chains
✅ TypeScript SDK
✅ Multiple security audits remediated

This isn't a whitepaper. It's live infrastructure.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
We're raising a seed round to scale this to $1B+ TVL.

If you're a DeFi investor, protocol founder, or just someone who thinks stablecoins should pay you — DMs are open.

kerne.ai
```

## Step 4B: Post Standalone Tweet

Post this as a SEPARATE tweet (NOT part of the thread):

```
Kerne's delta-neutral engine has been live on Hyperliquid for 4 days.

The architecture:
→ ETH deposited into ERC-4626 vault on Base
→ Equal short position opened on Hyperliquid perps
→ Zero price exposure
→ Earn funding rates + staking yield

All autonomous. All on-chain verifiable.

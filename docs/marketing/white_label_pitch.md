# KERNE WHITE-LABEL PITCH: INSTITUTIONAL YIELD INFRASTRUCTURE

**Target:** High-Net-Worth Individuals, DAO Treasuries, and Boutique Funds.
**Objective:** Deploy a private, branded yield-bearing vault in < 24 hours.

---

## 1. The Problem
Most yield strategies are either too risky (DeFi degen) or too low-yield (Treasuries). Managing a delta-neutral hedge manually is impossible for most funds.

## 2. The Kerne Solution
We provide the **full stack** for delta-neutral yield generation:
-   **Smart Contracts:** Audited ERC-4626 vaults on Base.
-   **Hedging Engine:** Institutional-grade Python bot managing CEX shorts.
-   **Transparency:** Real-time dashboard for LPs.
-   **Security:** Multisig control and automated panic triggers.

## 3. White-Label Offering
For a one-time setup fee, we deploy:
1.  **Your Branded Vault:** (e.g., `[YourName] Capital Vault`).
2.  **Dedicated Bot Instance:** Isolated hedging logic for your capital.
3.  **Custom Dashboard:** Your logo, your domain, your metrics.
4.  **Full Support:** 24/7 monitoring and maintenance.

## 4. Pricing (Direct to Founder)
-   **Tier 1 (Standard):** **$5,000 Upfront Setup Fee** + 10% Performance Fee.
-   **Tier 2 (Enterprise):** **$10,000 Upfront Setup Fee** + 5% Performance Fee (High TVL).

*Note: Setup fees are paid directly to the Kerne Founder's wallet upon contract signing. These fees are separate from the capital (TVL) you deposit into the vault.*

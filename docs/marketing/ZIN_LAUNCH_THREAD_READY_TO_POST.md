## TWEET 1 (HOOK)

```
🧵 We just shipped something big on @base

Introducing ZIN — Zero-Fee Intent Network

Kerne is now filling intents from @UniswapX & @CoWSwap with:

✅ Zero fees for authorized solvers
✅ 0.30% for public flash loans  
✅ All profits flow to vault LPs

How it works 👇
```

**Character count:** ~280 ✅

## TWEET 2 (MECHANISM)

```
How ZIN works:

1️⃣ User submits intent (swap ETH → USDC)
2️⃣ ZIN Solver detects profitable opportunity
3️⃣ Kerne fills using internal liquidity
4️⃣ Spread captured → distributed to LPs

Every trade shows "Filled by Kerne" 🔵

2/5
```

**Character count:** ~240 ✅

## TWEET 3 (COMPETITIVE EDGE)

```
Why this matters:

Traditional solvers compete on SPEED.
Kerne competes on CAPITAL EFFICIENCY.

Our delta-neutral vault gives us an edge:
• We hold inventory without directional risk
• We capture funding rates while waiting
• Zero opportunity cost on idle capital

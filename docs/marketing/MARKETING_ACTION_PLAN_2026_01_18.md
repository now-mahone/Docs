## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today/This Week)

### 1. DefiLlama PR - RESPOND NOW! 🚨
**Priority: CRITICAL** - This is the #1 inbound funnel

**STATUS:**
- PR #17648: **CLOSED** (reviewer said yields go to separate repo)
- PR #17645: **OPEN** ✅ - Waiting for YOUR response!

**BLOCKER:** Reviewer `waynebruce0x` asked 5 days ago:
> "Where can I see an example of a WETH deposit tx?"

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/pull/17645
2. Make a small WETH deposit to the vault (even 0.001 WETH works)
3. Reply with the transaction hash

**Vault Address:** `0xDF9a2f5152c533F7fcc3bAdEd41e157C9563C695`
**BaseScan:** https://basescan.org/address/0xDF9a2f5152c533F7fcc3bAdEd41e157C9563C695

**Sample Response:**
```
Here's an example WETH deposit transaction:
https://basescan.org/tx/[YOUR_TX_HASH]

The vault uses standard ERC-4626 deposit() function.
```

⚠️ **NOTE:** The PR uses OLD vault address `0x5FD0F7eA40984a6a8E9c6f6BDfd297e7dB4448Bd`
You may need to update the PR with the new address OR deposit to the old vault.

## NEXT STEP RECOMMENDATION

**Start with DefiLlama** - Check PR status and resubmit if needed. This is passive inbound that works 24/7 once live.

Then **do 2-3 whale DMs** using the Twitter template. Focus on addresses that show DeFi activity (not just holding).

### 1. Sam Kazemian (@samkazemian) - Frax Founder
> Hey Sam — big fan of your work on Frax. I'm building Kerne Protocol — a yield-bearing stablecoin (kUSD) that routes collateral yield across 200+ strategies instead of depending on a single source like Ethena's basis trade.
>
> We're live on Base/Arbitrum with 20+ contracts and a delta-neutral engine running on Hyperliquid. Shipped everything in 6 weeks. Raising a small angel round before our seed. Your expertise in stablecoins would be incredibly valuable. Happy to share the deck?

### 2. Jordi Alexander (@0xJordi) - Selini Capital
> Hey Jordi — following your takes on basis trade dynamics. I'm building Kerne Protocol — we've built an omnichain Yield Routing Engine that automates delta-neutral basis trading across 7+ chains.
>
> 20.3% APY backtested on 18mo real data (Sharpe 33.46). We're raising an angel round and would love to get your eyes on the architecture. No ask, just genuinely curious what a basis expert thinks of our YRE.

### 3. Kain Warwick (@kaboroshi) - Synthetix Founder
> Hey Kain — building Kerne Protocol on Base. We're doing omnichain yield-bearing stablecoins with a diversified routing engine. Shipped 20+ contracts and full infra in 6 weeks.
>
> Raising an angel round and would love to have a synthetic asset OG in the mix. Can I send over the executive summary?

### 4. Robert Leshner (@rleshner) - Compound Founder
> Hey Robert — building Kerne Protocol, the yield layer for Base. We've built ERC-4626 vaults that route yield across 200+ strategies.
>
> We're live on mainnet and raising an angel round. Your experience with Compound and institutional DeFi would be a massive asset. 20 mins to walk you through the YRE?

### 5. Cobie (@coaboroshi)
> Hey Cobie — building Kerne Protocol. Omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin that doesn't blow up when funding goes negative (diversified routing).
>
> Live on 3 chains, 20+ contracts, shipped in 6 weeks. Raising an angel round. kerne.ai if you want to poke around. Can I send the deck?

>
> You get your own branded vault, dedicated hedging bot, and custom dashboard. We handle the tech, you keep the yield. Interested in a 5-min demo of the private infrastructure?

### 2. 0xCBBF...eC7C ($360k)
> Hey! Saw your USDC position on Base. We're deploying private, delta-neutral yield vaults for whales. 15%+ APY with zero directional risk.

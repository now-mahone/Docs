# Approach Plan for Lead #1: 0xfd38C1E85EC5B20BBdd4aF39c4Be7e4D91e43561 (Whale)

## 1. Target Profile
- **Identity:** High-net-worth Base power user.
- **Current Position:** ~$540k USDC in Aave (earning 3-5%).
- **Pain Point:** Yield decay and under-utilization of stablecoin stack.

## 2. The Outreach Strategy (Whisper Phase)
**Channel:** XMTP via Burner Wallet (ENS Identity Proxy + Institutional Mirroring)
**Tone:** Institutional, Technical, High Signal

### Draft Message:

3. **Initial Contact:** Send the Whisper message via XMTP from the Burner Wallet.
4. **Follow-up:** If no response in 24h, we will move to the next lead.

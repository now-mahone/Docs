# Kerne Protocol — Investor Outreach DMs
### Ready to Copy-Paste | Created: 2026-02-10

## DM TEMPLATE 1: For DeFi VCs (Tier 1)
**Use for:** Dragonfly, Framework, Delphi, Mechanism, Polychain, Nascent, Variant

```
Hey [Name] — I'm building Kerne Protocol, an omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin (kUSD) with a diversified Yield Routing Engine that solves the single-strategy risk problem plaguing Ethena and the yield ceiling limiting sDAI.

We've shipped 20+ contracts across 3 chains in 6 weeks — vault, stablecoin, PSM, OFT bridges, intent network, hedging bot — all live on mainnet. Just validated 21.78% APY and 99.73% survival rate through 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.

Raising a $3-8M seed. Would love 20 minutes to walk you through the architecture. Here's the summary: [link to exec summary or whitepaper]

## DM TEMPLATE 2: For Angel Investors (Tier 3)
**Use for:** Protocol founders, DeFi whales, CT figures

```
Hey [Name] — big fan of your work on [their protocol/content]. I'm building Kerne Protocol — a yield-bearing stablecoin that routes collateral yield across 200+ DeFi strategies instead of depending on a single source like Ethena's basis trade.

We're live on Base/Arbitrum/Optimism with 20+ contracts, 154 passing tests, and a delta-neutral engine running on Hyperliquid. Shipped everything in 6 weeks with a 3-person team.

Key validation: Our Monte Carlo simulation just confirmed 99.73% protocol survival across 10,000 stress scenarios with 21.78% APY.

Raising a small angel round before our seed. Your expertise in [stablecoins/yield/DeFi infrastructure] would be incredibly valuable. Happy to share the deck if you're interested.

## DM TEMPLATE 3: For Strategic Investors (Tier 2)
**Use for:** Wintermute, GSR, exchange venture arms

```
Hey [Name] — I'm the founder of Kerne Protocol, building kUSD — an omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin backed by diversified DeFi yield (not single-strategy like Ethena).

We're live on 3 chains with full infrastructure and raising a seed round. We're specifically looking for strategic partners who can provide [market making / exchange distribution / integration support] alongside capital.

Would love to explore a strategic investment. Here's our summary: [link]

## DM TEMPLATE 4: For Accelerators
**Use for:** Alliance DAO, Outlier Ventures

```
Hey — applying to [Alliance DAO / program name] with Kerne Protocol. We're building the omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin — kUSD earns 21.78% APY through a diversified Yield Routing Engine across 200+ DeFi strategies.

In 6 weeks our 3-person team has shipped: 20+ smart contracts on 3 chains, a delta-neutral hedging engine, full frontend, SDK, and security suite. Just validated 99.73% survival rate through 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.

Is there a specific application form or should I send materials directly?

## DM TEMPLATE 5: Cold DM for CT Influencers / KOLs
**Use for:** Building awareness, not investment

```
Hey [Name] — been following your coverage of [yield-bearing stablecoins / DeFi yield / basis trading]. We just shipped Kerne Protocol — an omnichain yield-bearing stablecoin that diversifies yield across 200+ strategies instead of depending on a single basis trade.

Live on 3 chains, 20+ contracts. Just validated 21.78% APY and 99.73% survival rate through 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Would love to get your take on the architecture if you have a few minutes.

kerne.ai if you want to poke around.

## TWITTER THREAD: "Why I'm Building Kerne" (Post from @KerneProtocol)

**Tweet 1:**
```
$170B+ sits in stablecoins earning zero yield.

Circle makes $1.5B/year from YOUR capital. Tether makes $3B+. You get nothing.

We're building @KerneProtocol to fix this. Here's why kUSD is the stablecoin that pays you back 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The yield-bearing stablecoin thesis is proven:

• Ethena (USDe): $0 → $3.6B in 5 months
• MakerDAO (sDAI): billions in deposits
• Market screaming for this product

But every solution has a fatal flaw.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Ethena = single strategy risk. 100% basis trade. When funding rates flip negative, yield goes to zero (or worse).

MakerDAO = yield ceiling. Capped at their own lending revenue. 3-8% max.

Manual farming = full-time job. Gas, rebalancing, risk monitoring across dozens of protocols.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
kUSD solves all three:

1. Deposit yield-bearing collateral (stETH, eETH, rETH)
2. Mint kUSD at 150% collateral ratio
3. Yield Routing Engine allocates across 200+ strategies on 7+ chains
4. kUSD rebases daily — 21.78% APY validated through Monte Carlo simulation

Overcollateralized. Not algorithmic. Not single-strategy.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
What we've shipped in 6 weeks:

✅ 20+ smart contracts on Base, Arbitrum, Optimism
✅ Delta-neutral basis trade live on Hyperliquid
✅ 154 passing Foundry tests
✅ Full frontend at kerne.ai
✅ LayerZero V2 OFT bridging across 3 chains
✅ TypeScript SDK
✅ Multiple security audits remediated

This isn't a whitepaper. It's live infrastructure.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
We're raising a seed round to scale this to $1B+ TVL.

If you're a DeFi investor, protocol founder, or just someone who thinks stablecoins should pay you — DMs are open.

## FOLLOW-UP DM (Send 5-7 days after initial DM if no response)

```
Hey [Name] — following up on my message about Kerne Protocol. We've made progress since then — just completed Monte Carlo v4 simulation validating 99.73% survival rate across 10,000 scenarios with 21.78% APY.

Totally understand if the timing isn't right. If you know anyone who might be interested in the yield-bearing stablecoin space, happy to take an intro too.

## RULES FOR OUTREACH

1. **Personalize every DM.** Reference something specific about the person — their fund's portfolio, a tweet they wrote, a talk they gave. Generic DMs get ignored.
2. **Send 5-10 DMs per day.** Not 50. Quality over quantity. Research each target for 5 minutes before writing.
3. **Follow up exactly once** after 5-7 days. If no response after follow-up, move on.
4. **Track everything.** Log every DM sent, response received, and meeting scheduled in a spreadsheet.
5. **Post the Twitter thread BEFORE sending DMs.** Investors will check your profile. It needs to show substance.
6. **Never lead with the ask.** Lead with the insight, the architecture, the traction. The ask comes after they're interested.

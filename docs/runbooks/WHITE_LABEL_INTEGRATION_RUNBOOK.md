# Kerne White-Label Integration Runbook

This document outlines the process for onboarding B2B partners to the Kerne Protocol using the White-Label SDK and Template.

## 1. Partner Onboarding Process

### Phase 1: Agreement & Setup Fee
- **Action:** Partner selects a vault tier (BASIC, PRO, INSTITUTIONAL).
- **Revenue:** Partner pays the deployment fee (Setup Fee) as defined in `KerneVaultFactory.sol`.
    - **BASIC:** 0.05 ETH
    - **PRO:** 0.2 ETH
    - **INSTITUTIONAL:** 1 ETH
- **Execution:** Partner uses the Kerne Admin Terminal or the SDK to call `deployVault`.

### Phase 2: Customization
- **Action:** Partner clones the `white-label-template` repository.
- **Action:** Partner updates `kerne-config.json` with their brand details and deployed contract addresses.
- **Action:** Partner customizes the UI (colors, logos) in the template.

### Phase 3: Deployment
- **Action:** Partner deploys their customized frontend to Vercel or a similar platform.
- **Action:** Partner connects their domain.

## 2. Revenue Capture Mechanisms

### Setup Fees (Upfront)
Setup fees are captured during the `deployVault` transaction. The `KerneVaultFactory` automatically transfers these fees to the `feeRecipient` (Kerne Treasury).

### Performance Fees (Ongoing)
Kerne captures a portion of the performance fees generated by white-label vaults.
- **Protocol Founder Fee:** A percentage of the gross yield (e.g., 5-10%) is captured by the Kerne founder.
- **Partner Performance Fee:** The partner sets their own performance fee (gross), and Kerne's cut is taken from that or added on top.
- **Implementation:** The `captureFounderWealth` function in `KerneVault.sol` handles the distribution of these fees.

## 3. Technical Integration (SDK)

Partners can use the `@kerne/sdk` to build custom integrations.

```typescript
import { KerneSDK, VaultTier } from '@kerne/sdk';

const sdk = new KerneSDK(FACTORY_ADDRESS, RPC_URL, walletClient);

// Deploy a new vault
const tx = await sdk.deployVault({
    asset: '0x...',
    name: 'Partner Yield Vault',
    symbol: 'pYV',
    admin: partnerAdminAddress,
    performanceFeeBps: 1000, // 10%
    whitelistEnabled: true,
    maxTotalAssets: parseEther('1000'),
    tier: VaultTier.PRO
});
```

## 4. Support & Maintenance
- Kerne provides the underlying hedging infrastructure and strategy.
- Partners are responsible for their own frontend and user acquisition.
- Kerne takes a "Platform Tax" on all yield generated through white-label instances.

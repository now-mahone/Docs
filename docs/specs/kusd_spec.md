# kUSD: The Kerne Synthetic Dollar

**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Status:** DRAFT / RESEARCH

---

## 1. Overview
kUSD is a synthetic dollar native to the Kerne ecosystem. It is designed to be the primary medium of exchange and unit of account for Kerne's delta-neutral yield strategies.

## 2. Mechanism
kUSD is minted against **KerneVault Shares (kLP)** as collateral.

### 2.1. Minting
-   Users deposit WETH into the `KerneVault`.
-   Users receive `kLP` shares.
-   Users can lock `kLP` shares into the `kUSD Minter` to mint kUSD.
-   **Collateral Ratio (CR):** 150% (Target). For every $150 worth of kLP, $100 kUSD can be minted.

### 2.2. Stability Module
-   **Delta-Neutral Backing:** The underlying WETH in the vault is hedged 1:1 on CEXs. This ensures the principal value of the collateral remains stable in USD terms.
-   **Yield Capture:** The funding rate yield generated by the vault is used to:
    1.  Increase the value of kLP shares.
    2.  Incentivize kUSD liquidity pools.
    3.  Buy back and burn $KERNE tokens.

## 3. Use Cases
-   **Leveraged Yield:** Users can mint kUSD, swap for WETH, and redeposit into the vault to multiply their yield.
-   **DeFi Integration:** kUSD will be integrated into Aerodrome, Curve, and Morpho as a high-quality collateral asset.
-   **Institutional Settlement:** A stable, yield-bearing dollar for institutional partners.

## 4. Risk Management
-   **Liquidation:** If the CR falls below 120%, the kLP collateral is liquidated to repay the kUSD debt.
-   **Depeg Protection:** The Stability Module can use the vault's withdrawal buffer to maintain the kUSD peg during extreme volatility.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap
1.  **Smart Contract Development:** `kUSD.sol` (ERC-20) and `kUSDMinter.sol`.
2.  **Audit:** Dedicated security review of the minting and liquidation logic.
3.  **Liquidity Launch:** Seed kUSD/USDC pools on Base.

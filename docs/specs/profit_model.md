## 1. Core Revenue Streams
Kerne generates revenue through two primary channels:

2.  **White-Label Setup Fees:** Upfront fees for deploying custom infrastructure for partners.

## 2. Performance Fee Projections
Assumptions:
-   **Target APY:** 12% (Net of exchange fees).
-   **Performance Fee:** 10% of generated yield.
-   **ETH Price:** $3,000 (Base for calculation).

| Target Daily Profit | Required Annual Yield | Required TVL (ETH) | Required TVL (USD) |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|

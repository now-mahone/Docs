# KERNE PROFIT MODEL & REVENUE PROJECTIONS

**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Version:** 1.0.0

## 1. Core Revenue Streams
Kerne generates revenue through two primary channels:
1.  **Performance Fees:** 10% commission on all yield generated by the delta-neutral strategy.
2.  **White-Label Setup Fees:** Upfront fees for deploying custom infrastructure for partners.

## 2. Performance Fee Tiers

Kerne implements a **tiered performance fee structure** designed to bootstrap TVL growth while rewarding early adopters.

### Promotional Launch Tier: 0% Performance Fee

| TVL Range | Performance Fee | User APY (at 12% gross) | Protocol Revenue |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **$0 - $100,000** | **0%** | **12.00%** | $0 |
| $100,000 - $500,000 | 5% | 11.40% | ~$200/year |
| $500,000 - $1,000,000 | 10% | 10.80% | ~$600/year |
| $1,000,000+ | 10% | 10.80% | $1,200+/year |

### Economic Rationale for 0% Launch Tier

**Why 0% for the first $100k TVL?**
1. **Maximum Yield to Early Users** — Users keep 100% of generated yield, creating the strongest possible referral incentive
2. **Competitive Positioning** — Beats sDAI (3-8%), competes with Ethena on risk-adjusted basis with better transparency
3. **Network Effects Bootstrap** — First $100k TVL creates "institutional confidence" appearance for DeFiLlama listings
4. **Cheap CAC** — $1,200/year foregone revenue vs $10-20K KOL partnerships or $100-500K CEX listings

**At $100,000 TVL with 12% Gross APY:**

| Scenario | User APY | Annual User Earnings | Protocol Revenue |
|----------|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| **0% Fee (Launch)** | 12.00% | $12,000 | $0 |
| 10% Fee (Standard) | 10.80% | $10,800 | $1,200 |
| **Difference** | +1.2% | +$1,200 | -$1,200 |

### Standard Fee Projections (Post-Promotional)
Assumptions:
-   **Target APY:** 12% (Net of exchange fees).
-   **Performance Fee:** 10% of generated yield (after promotional tier).
-   **ETH Price:** $3,000 (Base for calculation).

| Target Daily Profit | Required Annual Yield | Required TVL (ETH) | Required TVL (USD) |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **$100/day**        | $36,500               | ~122 ETH           | ~$365,000          |
| **$500/day**        | $182,500              | ~608 ETH           | ~$1,825,000        |
| **$1,000/day**      | $365,000              | ~1,217 ETH         | ~$3,650,000        |

*Note: At $1,000/day profit, the protocol is generating $3.65M in annual yield for users.*

## 3. White-Label Pricing Tiers
Kerne Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) allows institutional partners to deploy their own branded vaults.

### Tier 1: Basic ($1,500)
-   Standard ERC-4626 Vault Deployment.
-   Shared Hedging Engine Instance.

## 4. Scalability & Margin
As TVL grows, the operational cost of the hedging bot remains relatively flat (VPS + Gas), leading to significant margin expansion at higher TVL levels.
-   **Break-even TVL:** ~50 ETH (Covers VPS and basic gas costs).
-   **High-Margin Zone:** > 500 ETH.

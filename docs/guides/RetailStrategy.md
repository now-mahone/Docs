# Kerne Protocol: Retail Strategy
## The "Liquidity Black Hole" Framework

This document serves as the master template for Kerne's retail-focused growth. It combines game-theoretic incentives with viral narrative loops to bootstrap organic TVL and community evangelism.

### 1. Strategic Rationale (The "Why")

*   **Kerne Points (The Switching Cost):** Retail capital is inherently mercenary. By implementing points, we create a "switching cost"—leaving Kerne means forgoing future airdrop value. The multi-tier referral structure (10% + 5%) is designed to attract "Alpha Callers" who will act as our primary distribution channel.
*   **Prisoner's Dilemma (The Loyalty Filter):** Most airdrops suffer from a "claim and dump" event. Our mechanism forces a choice: take a small win now or a massive win later. This effectively "taxes" mercenary capital and redistributes it to the loyalists who will actually govern the protocol.
*   **"The Vortex" (Narrative Simplification):** "Delta-neutral basis trading" is a barrier to entry. "The Vortex" is a powerful visual metaphor suggesting that Kerne is an unstoppable force that sucks in yield from across the market and concentrates it into the user's wallet.

### 2. Core Mechanics

#### A. The Points System (Kerne Points)
*   **Deposit Points:** 1 point per $1 deposited per day.
*   **Referral Points:** 10% of all points earned by referees, plus a 5% second-tier bonus.
*   **Social Quests:** One-time point boosts for following @KerneProtocol, joining Discord, and sharing "Yield Proofs."
*   **Loyalty Multipliers:**
    *   7-day streak: 1.1x multiplier.
    *   30-day streak: 1.5x multiplier.

#### B. The "Prisoner's Dilemma" Airdrop
*   **The Choice:** At TGE, users can claim 25% of their airdrop immediately (Mercenary Path) or lock 100% for 6 months to receive a "Loyalist Bonus" (redistributed from the 75% penalty of Mercenaries).
*   **Impact:** Ensures long-term alignment and reduces immediate sell pressure.

### 3. Attention-Gaining Alternatives (The "How")

#### A. Farcaster "Yield Frames" (Warpcast)
*   **The Play:** A Frame that allows users to see their real-time points, vault APY, and "Global Yield Captured" directly in their feed.
*   **Conversion:** One-click "Boost My Yield" button that triggers a deposit transaction without leaving the app.

#### B. "Yield Proof" Social Validation
*   **The Play:** A "Share My Yield" button in the dashboard that generates a high-fidelity, branded image of their current APY and "Total Yield Earned."
*   **Viral Loop:** Users who share their "Yield Proof" on Twitter/Farcaster earn a 1.1x point multiplier for 24 hours.

#### C. The "Shadow Solver" Competition
*   **The Play:** A "Retail Solver" leaderboard where users can "back" specific solver strategies with small amounts of kUSD.
*   **The Hook:** "Earn like a pro-trader without writing a line of code." Transforms Kerne from a passive vault into an active "Hedge Fund in your Pocket."

#### D. Educational "Quest" Partnerships
*   **The Play:** Partner with **Galxe** or **Layer3** for a "Kerne Academy" series.
*   **The Hook:** Users earn points for watching a 30-second "Vortex" animation and passing a quiz on why Kerne's math (Sharpe 33.46) is superior to Ethena.

#### E. ASMR Financial Animations
*   **The Play:** Use the Revideo infrastructure to release "Vortex" animations—high-quality, satisfying visuals of capital flowing through the protocol layers.

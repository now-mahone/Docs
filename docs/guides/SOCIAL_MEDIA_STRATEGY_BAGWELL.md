# Kerne Protocol: Social Media Strategy & Execution Guide
### Operational Playbook for Bagwell (Twitter & LinkedIn)

---

## 1. Core Objectives
1.  **Institutional Authority:** Position Kerne as the most secure, delta-neutral yield layer in DeFi.
2.  **Lead Generation:** Drive VCs, Whales, and Institutional Allocators to the [Institutional Data Room](../data-room/README.md).
3.  **Ecosystem Density:** Build presence within the Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism communities.

## 2. Content Pillars (The "Trust Trinity")

### Pillar A: Technical Edge (The "How")
*   **Topics:** Delta-neutral basis trading, Yield Routing Engine (YRE), Sharpe Ratio (33.46), Proof of Solvency.
*   **Goal:** Prove that our yield isn't "magic"—it's math.
*   **Resource:** [Risk Mitigation Specification](../research/RISK_MITIGATION_SPEC.md).

### Pillar B: Institutional Trust (The "Safety")
*   **Topics:** Security audits, "Capital Fortress" framework, Risk Mitigation Deep-Dive, Solvency attestations.
*   **Goal:** De-risk the protocol for large allocators.
*   **Resource:** [Risk Mitigation Deep-Dive (Internal)](../research/RISK_PDF_SCRIPT.md).

### Pillar C: Growth & Momentum (The "Why Now")
*   **Topics:** TVL milestones, new chain expansions, partnership announcements, "Liquidity Black Hole" thesis.
*   **Goal:** Create FOMO and show execution velocity.
*   **Resource:** [Kerne Genesis Strategy](../../KERNE_GENESIS_NEW.md).

## 4. Content Templates

### Twitter Thread Template (Risk Mitigation)
1.  **Hook:** "DeFi yield is easy. Protecting $1B+ in capital is hard. Here is how Kerne Protocol built the 'Capital Fortress' for institutional allocators. 🧵"
2.  **The Problem:** "Most protocols rely on single-strategy yield. When the market turns, they bleed. Kerne uses delta-neutral basis trading to capture yield with ZERO directional exposure."
3.  **The Solution:** "Our 3-layer defense: 1. Real-time Sentinel monitoring. 2. Multi-venue hedging (Hyperliquid/Binance). 3. On-chain Proof of Solvency."
4.  **The Proof:** "Backtested Sharpe Ratio: 33.46. Max Drawdown: 0.15%. We don't guess; we engineer."
5.  **CTA:** "Explore our 'Capital Fortress' framework in the Institutional Data Room: [Link to Data Room]"

### LinkedIn Post Template (Financial Model)
> **Headline:** Why Institutional Allocators are moving to Delta-Neutral Yield.
>
> The "Yield Mystery" is the biggest barrier to institutional DeFi adoption. Allocators need to know exactly where the money comes from and how it's protected.
>
> We just released our Live Financial Model (Google Sheets) in the Kerne Data Room. It allows you to stress-test our TVL assumptions and see the exact revenue flow from funding rates and staking rebases.
>
> **Key Metrics:**
> ✅ 20.3% Backtested APY
> ✅ 50% Buy-and-Burn Tokenomics
> ✅ 100% Solvency Transparency
>

## 5. Operational Rules (CRITICAL)

1.  **The "We" Rule:** Always use "we", "our", or "Kerne Protocol Team". Never use "I".
2.  **Decisive Tone:** Be authoritative. We are the architects of the yield layer.
3.  **No Codenames:** Never use "Scofield" or "Mahone" in public. Use "The Founders" or "Lead Architect".
4.  **Data-Backed:** Every claim must be linkable to a document in the Data Room.
5.  **Engagement:** When replying to @jessepollak or @base, focus on how Kerne adds value to the Base ecosystem (e.g., "Bringing institutional liquidity to Base").

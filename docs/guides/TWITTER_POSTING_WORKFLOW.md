# Kerne Protocol: Twitter Posting Workflow
### Operational Guide for Bagwell & Cline

This document defines the autonomous reminder and drafting system for Kerne Protocol's Twitter presence.

---

## 1. The "Reminder" Protocol
**Cline Instruction:** Every 2-3 days, at the start of a session with Bagwell, you MUST:
1.  Check the latest entries in `project_state.md`.
2.  Identify the key milestones achieved in the last 48-72 hours.
3.  **Draft a "Twitter-friendly" post ONLY at this moment** to ensure the information is perfectly relevant to the most recent progress.
4.  Present the draft to Bagwell and remind him to post it.
5.  **MANDATORY:** Once Bagwell confirms the post, Cline MUST log the final tweet content into `docs/marketing/TWEET_HISTORY.md` immediately.

**CRITICAL RULE:** Do not pre-draft tweets. Drafts must be generated in real-time during the reminder session.

## 2. Drafting Guidelines
*   **Tone:** Professional, authoritative, and high-velocity.
*   **Format:** Use bullet points or short sentences. Max 280 characters.
*   **Safety:** NEVER include private keys, internal codenames (Scofield/Mahone), specific wallet balances (unless public TVL), or sensitive infrastructure details.
*   **Engagement:** Tag @base or relevant partners (Lido, Aerodrome) when applicable.
*   **News Integration:** Occasionally blend a protocol update with a relevant crypto news item (e.g., "With ETH L2 activity hitting ATHs, Kerne is positioning to capture...")

## 3. Content Pillars for Tweets
*   **Shipping Updates:** New contracts, audits, or documentation.
*   **TVL/Yield Milestones:** Backtested results or live performance.
*   **Institutional Trust:** Data Room expansions or Risk Mitigation insights.
*   **Ecosystem Growth:** New chain deployments or partnerships.

# ZIN Solver Activation Status Report
**Date:** 2026-01-26 20:30 MST
**Author:** Cline (Lead Architect)
**Priority:** #1 - ZIN Solver Live Extraction Activation

---

## Executive Summary

The ZIN Solver infrastructure is **fully built and operational**, but activation is **BLOCKED** due to zero liquidity in both ZIN Pools (Base and Arbitrum).

---

## Infrastructure Status

### ✅ Components Working

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| ZIN Solver Code | ✅ Ready | `bot/solver/zin_solver.py` - Complete with 5 intent fetchers |
| Base RPC | ✅ Connected | `https://base.llamarpc.com` |
| Arbitrum RPC | ✅ Connected | `https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc` |
| Intent Fetchers | ✅ Implemented | CowSwap, UniswapX, 1inch Fusion, LI.FI, Aori |
| Contracts Deployed | ✅ Live | Base + Arbitrum ZIN Executor & Pool |
| Guardrails | ✅ Configured | min_profit=10bps, max_gas=25gwei |
| Live Mode | ✅ Enabled | `ZIN_SOLVER_LIVE=true` |

### ❌ BLOCKER: Zero Liquidity

| Chain | ZIN Pool Address | USDC Balance | WETH Balance | Status |
|-------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Base | `0xB9BdF6F3Fc3819b61f6fE799bE1395501822d0c7` | **0 USDC** | **0 WETH** | ❌ Empty |
| Arbitrum | `0x5D8ddE6264DF8A0963253693f32e057e1aA37aFD` | **0 USDC** | **0 WETH** | ❌ Empty |

### Deployer Wallet Status

| Chain | Address | ETH Balance | Status |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Base | `0x57D400cED462a01Ed51a5De038F204Df49690A99` | **0 ETH** | ❌ No gas |
| Arbitrum | `0x57D400cED462a01Ed51a5De038F204Df49690A99` | 0.000659 ETH | ⚠️ Minimal |

## Treasury Ledger Discrepancy

The Treasury Ledger (`docs/TREASURY_LEDGER.md`) shows:
- 2026-01-18: 39.772851 USDC seeded to ZIN Pool (Base)
- 2026-01-18: 0.01178582 WETH seeded to ZIN Pool (Base)

**Current on-chain balance: 0**

Possible explanations:
1. Funds were withdrawn
2. Funds were used in a test transaction
3. Original deposit transaction failed
4. Funds were moved to a different address

---

## What's Needed to Activate

### Minimum Requirements

1. **Seed Liquidity:** ~$50-100 in USDC and/or WETH to ZIN Pool
2. **Gas for Deployer:** ~$1-2 in ETH on Base for transaction fees

### Recommended Seed Amounts

| Token | Amount | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| USDC | $50 | Primary intent fulfillment |
| WETH | 0.02 (~$67) | ETH-based intent fulfillment |
| ETH (gas) | 0.001 (~$3.35) | Transaction fees |

## Options for Scofield

### Option A: Seed Capital & Activate (Recommended)
- Provide ~$100-120 total capital
- Deposit to ZIN Pool + gas to deployer
- Activate solver immediately
- Expected: 1-3 small fills/day, $0.10-0.50 daily profit initially

### Option B: Dry-Run Mode
- Run solver with `--dry-run` flag
- Collect intent flow data
- Validate detection logic
- No capital required, no profit generated

### Option C: Pivot to Different Priority
- Move to Priority #2 or another task
- Return to ZIN activation when capital is available

---

## Deposit Instructions (If Option A Selected)

### Step 1: Fund Deployer Wallet
Send ETH to: `0x57D400cED462a01Ed51a5De038F204Df49690A99`
- Base: ~0.001 ETH for gas
- Amount: ~$3-5 worth

### Step 2: Seed ZIN Pool
Transfer tokens directly to ZIN Pool: `0xB9BdF6F3Fc3819b61f6fE799bE1395501822d0c7`
- USDC (Base): `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- WETH (Base): `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006`

### Step 3: Activate Solver
```bash
cd z:\kerne-new
python bot/solver/zin_solver.py --interval 5.0
```

## Next Steps

Awaiting Scofield's decision on which option to proceed with.
